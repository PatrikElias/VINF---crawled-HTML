<ul><li>The first period, from the beginning of European hostilities in September 1939 to the end of the "<a href="/wiki/Phoney_War" title="Phoney War">Phoney War</a>", saw both the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a> and the Axis powers intercepting neutral merchant ships to seize deliveries <i>en route</i> to their respective enemies. Naval blockade at this time proved less than effective because the Axis could get crucial materials from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union_in_World_War_II" title="Soviet Union in World War II">Soviet Union</a> until <a href="/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa" title="Operation Barbarossa">June 1941</a>, while Berlin used harbours in <a href="/wiki/Spain_during_World_War_II" title="Spain during World War II">Spain</a> to import war materials into Germany.</li>
<li>The second period began after the rapid Axis occupation of the majority of the European landmass (Scandinavia, Benelux, France and the Balkans) in 1940–1941, resulting in Axis control of major centres of industry and agriculture.</li>
<li>The third period started in December 1941 after the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service" title="Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service">Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service</a> brought the U.S. into the European war.</li>

<p>At the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" class="mw-redirect" title="First World War">First World War</a> in 1914, the United Kingdom used its powerful navy and its geographical location to dictate the movement of the world's commercial shipping.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Britain dominated the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and, due to its control of the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Canal" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> with France, access into and out of the <a href="/wiki/Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">allied</a> ships, while their enemies were forced to go around Africa.

His plan was to revive the original World War I blockade but to make it more streamlined, making better use of technology and Britain's vast overseas business and commercial network so that contacts in key trading locations such as <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> or <a href="/wiki/Buenos_Aires" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> could act as a vast information gathering system. Making use of tip-offs provided by a vast array of individuals such as bankers, merchant buyers, waterfront <a href="/wiki/Stevedores" class="mw-redirect" title="Stevedores">stevedores</a> and ship operators doing their patriotic duty, the Navy could have priceless advance knowledge of which ships might be carrying contraband long before they reached port.

<p>Initially the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, was not keen on the idea and still hoped to avoid war, but following his <a href="/wiki/Appeasement_of_Hitler" class="mw-redirect" title="Appeasement of Hitler">appeasement of Hitler</a> <a href="/wiki/Munich_Agreement" title="Munich Agreement">at Munich</a> in September 1938, which was widely seen as a stopgap measure to buy time, he too began to realise the need for urgent preparations for war. During the last 12 months of peace, Britain and France carried out a vigorous buildup of their armed forces and weapons production. The long-awaited <a href="/wiki/Spitfire" class="mw-redirect" title="Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighter began to enter service, the first of the new naval vessels ordered under the 1936 emergency programme began to join the fleet, and the Air Ministry made the final touches to the <a href="/wiki/Chain_Home" title="Chain Home">Chain Home</a> early warning network of radio direction-finding (later called <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a>) stations, to bring it up to full operational readiness.
</p><p>A joint British–French staff paper on strategic policy issued in April 1939 recognised that, in the first phase of any war with Germany, economic warfare was likely to be the Allies' only effective offensive weapon.<sup id="cite_ref-ConciseHistoryWWII_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ConciseHistoryWWII-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The Royal Navy war plans, delivered to the fleet in January 1939 set out three critical elements of a future war at sea.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-11_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-11-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The most fundamental consideration was the defence of trade in home waters and the Atlantic in order to maintain imports of the goods Britain needed for her own survival. Of secondary importance was the defence of trade in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. If Italy, as assumed also declared war and became an aggressive opponent, her dominating geographical position might force shipping to go the long way around the <a href="/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope" title="Cape of Good Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> (South Africa), but it was hoped to contain her with a strong fleet in the Mediterranean. Finally, there was the need for a vigorous blockade against Germany and Italy.

</p><p>Although France, unlike Britain, was largely self-sufficient in food and needed to import few foodstuffs, she still required extensive overseas imports of weapons and raw materials for her war effort and there was close co-operation between the two allies.

<p>Although U-boats were the main threat, there was also the threat posed by surface raiders to consider; the three "pocket battleships" which Germany was allowed to build under the <a href="/wiki/Versailles_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Versailles Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a> had been designed and built specifically with attacks on ocean commerce in mind. Their strong armour, 11&#160;inch guns and 26-knot (48&#160;km/h) speed enabled them to out-match any British cruiser, and two of them, the <a href="/wiki/German_cruiser_Admiral_Graf_Spee" title="German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee"><i>Admiral Graf Spee</i></a> and the <a href="/wiki/German_cruiser_Deutschland" title="German cruiser Deutschland"><i>Deutschland</i></a> had sailed between 21 and 24 August and were now loose on the high seas having evaded the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Patrol" title="Northern Patrol">Northern Patrol</a>, the navy squadron that patrolled between Scotland and <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>. The <i>Deutschland</i> remained off <a href="/wiki/Greenland" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> waiting for merchant vessels to attack, while the <i>Graf Spee</i> rapidly travelled south across the equator and soon began sinking British merchant ships in the southern Atlantic. Because the German fleet had insufficient capital ships to mount a traditional line of battle, the British and French were able to disperse their own fleets to form hunting groups to track down and sink German commerce raiders, but the hunt for the two raiders was to tie down no less than 23 important ships along with auxiliary craft and additional heavy ships to protect convoys.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The day after the declaration, the British Admiralty announced that all merchant vessels were now liable to examination by the naval Contraband Control Service and by the French Blockade Ministry, which put its ships under British command.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Because of the terrible suffering and starvation caused by the original use of the strategy, a formal declaration of blockade was deliberately not made,<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> but the <a href="/wiki/Communiqu%C3%A9" class="mw-redirect" title="Communiqué">communiqué</a> listed the types of contraband of war that was liable for confiscation if carried. It included all kinds of foodstuffs, animal feed, forage, and clothing, and articles and materials used in their production. This was known as Conditional Contraband of War. In addition, there was Absolute Contraband, which constituted:
</p>
<ul><li>All ammunition, explosives, chemicals or appliances suitable for use in <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">chemical warfare</a></li>
<li>Fuel of all kinds and all contrivances for means of transportation on land, in water or the air</li>
<li>All means of communication, tools, implements and instruments necessary for carrying on hostile operations</li>
<li>Coin, <a href="/wiki/Bullion" title="Bullion">bullion</a>, currency and evidences of debt</li></ul>
<p>The Royal Navy selected three locations on home soil for Contraband Control: <a href="/wiki/Weymouth,_Dorset" title="Weymouth, Dorset">Weymouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Downs_(ship_anchorage)" title="The Downs (ship anchorage)">The Downs</a> in the South to cover the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> approaches, and <a href="/wiki/Kirkwall" title="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> in <a href="/wiki/Orkney" title="Orkney">Orkney</a> to cover the North Sea. If ships were on government charter or sailing directly to Allied ports to unload cargo or passengers, they would not be detained any longer than was necessary to determine their identity, but if on other routes they were to stop at the designated contraband control ports for detailed examination. Ships proceeding eastward through the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> with the intention of passing the Downs, if not calling at any other Channel port, should call at Weymouth for contraband control examination.<sup id="cite_ref-TWI-28Oct39_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWI-28Oct39-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Ships bound for European ports or en route to the North of Scotland should call at Kirkwall.
</p><p>Three further British contraband inspection facilities were established at <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to control access into and out of the western Mediterranean, <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a> at the other end of the Mediterranean in Northern Palestine, and <a href="/wiki/Aden" title="Aden">Aden</a> on the Indian Ocean coast of <a href="/wiki/Yemen" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> at the southern entrance to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> to control access into the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. To patrol the Mediterranean and the Red Sea access to the Indian Ocean, Britain would work together with the French, whose own navy was the world's fourth largest, and comprised a good number of modern, powerful vessels with others nearing completion. It was agreed that the French would hold the Western Mediterranean Basin via <a href="/wiki/Marseilles" class="mw-redirect" title="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> and its base at <a href="/wiki/Mers_El_K%C3%A9bir" title="Mers El Kébir">Mers El Kébir</a> (Oran) on the coast of Algeria, while the British would hold the Eastern Basin via its base at <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>.

<p>The work of the actual inspection of cargoes was carried out by customs officers and Royal Naval officers and men who, together with their ships, were assigned to Contraband Control for various periods of duty. The job of Control Officer required great tact in the face of irate and defiant neutral skippers, particularly Dutch and Scandinavians who had a long tradition of trade with Germany. Contraband Control patrols dotted all practical <a href="/wiki/Sea_lane" title="Sea lane">sea routes</a>, stopping all neutral ships, and making life very difficult for any who tried to slip by, forcing them into ports and laying them up for days before inspection, in some cases ruining perishable goods. Control ports were often very overcrowded, <a href="/wiki/Teleprinter" title="Teleprinter">teleprinters</a> constantly sending out cargo listings and manifests to be checked against import quota lists. Even for innocent ships, a delay of a day or two was inevitable; Contraband Control officers were under instructions to be extremely polite and apologetic to all concerned. Neutral captains often expressed utter astonishment and bemusement at the level of British advance knowledge of their activities, and soon realised it was hard to hide anything. Although numerous attempts were made to bypass the blockade, the net was extremely hard to avoid, and most neutral captains voluntarily stopped at one of the eight Allied Contraband Control ports.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The job of co-ordinating the various agencies involved in the blockade was carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Warfare" class="mw-redirect" title="Ministry of Economic Warfare">Ministry of Economic Warfare</a> (MEW), which in the last few weeks before the outbreak of war had been set up by Frederick Leith-Ross. Leith-Ross had not been put off by <a href="/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain" title="Neville Chamberlain">Chamberlain</a>'s initially lukewarm reception to his plan to revive the blockade, but had in fact spent the time after Munich to continue his preparations regardless. Leith-Ross recruited shrewd bankers, statisticians, economists and experts in international law and an army of over 400 administrative workers and <a href="/wiki/Civil_servant" class="mw-redirect" title="Civil servant">civil servants</a> for his new ministry.<sup id="cite_ref-Life-15Jan40_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Life-15Jan40-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> It was their job to compile and sift through the raw intelligence being received from the various overseas and other contacts, to cross-reference it with the known data on ship movements and cargoes and to pass on any relevant information to Contraband Control. They also put together the Statutory List – sometimes known as the "blacklist" – of companies known to regularly trade with, or who were directly financed by, Germany. In mid-September the Ministry published a list of 278 pro-German persons and companies throughout the world with whom British merchants and shipowners were forbidden to do business, subject to heavy penalties. When shipments from these companies were detected they were usually made a priority for interception.
</p><p>One lesson that was learnt from World War I was that although the navy could stop ships on the open seas, little could be done about traders who acted as the middleman, importing materials the Nazis needed into their own neutral country then transporting it overland to Germany for a profit.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Leith–Ross spent the months before the war compiling a massive dossier on the annual quantities of materials the countries bordering Germany normally imported so that if they exceeded these levels in wartime, pressure could be brought on the authorities in those countries to take action. Diplomats from the Scandinavian nations, as well as Italy and the Balkan countries, who were also major suppliers to Germany, were given quota lists of various commodities and told they could import these amounts and no more, or action would be taken against them.
</p><p>A ship stopping at a Control port raised a red and white flag with a blue border to signify that it was awaiting examination. At night the port authorities used signal lights to warn a skipper he must halt, and the flag had to stay raised until the ship was passed. Arrangements for boarding and examining ships were made in the port "Boarding Room", and eventually a team of 2 officers and 6 men set out in a fishing drifter or motor launch to the ship. After apologising to the captain for the trouble, they inspected the ship's papers, manifest and <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_lading" title="Bill of lading">bills of lading</a>. At the same time the wireless cabin was sealed so no signals could be sent out while the ship was in the controlled zone. After satisfying themselves that the cargo corresponded with the written records, the party returned ashore and a summary of the manifest, passengers, ports of origin and destination was sent by teleprinter to the Ministry. When the ministry's consent was received, the ship's papers were returned to the captain along with a certificate of naval clearance and a number of special flags – one for each day – signifying that they had already been checked and could pass other patrols and ports without being stopped. If the Ministry found something suspicious, the team returned to examine the load. If part or all the cargo was found suspect the ship was directed to a more convenient port where the cargo was made a ward of the <a href="/wiki/Prize_court" title="Prize court">Prize Court</a> by the Admiralty Marshall who held it until the Court sat to decide the outcome, which could include returning it to the captain or confirming its confiscation to be sold at a later time and the proceeds placed into a prize fund for distribution among the fleet after the war. A disgruntled captain could dispute the seizure as illegal, but the list of banned goods was intentionally made broad to include "any goods capable of being used for or converted to the manufacture of war materials".
</p><p>In the first four weeks of the war, official figures stated that the Royal Navy confiscated 289,000 tons of contraband and the <a href="/wiki/French_Navy" title="French Navy">French <i>Marine Nationale</i></a> 100,000 tons. The Germans responded with their own counter-blockade of supplies destined for Allied ports and published a contraband list virtually identical to the British list.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> All neutral traffic from the <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Sea" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> was to pass through the Kiel Canal for inspection, but with a fraction of the naval forces of their enemies, the action was more in defiance, but it was destined to have a big impact on neutral Scandinavian shipping, who among other materials supplied Britain with large quantities of <a href="/wiki/Wood_pulp" class="mw-redirect" title="Wood pulp">wood pulp</a> for explosive cellulose and newsprint. Germany began by targeting the Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish pulp boats, sinking several before Sweden shut down its pulp industry and threatened to stop sending Germany iron ore unless the attacks ceased.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-9Oct39_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-9Oct39-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Germany then began seizing Danish ships carrying butter, eggs and bacon to Britain, in breach of a promise to allow Denmark to trade freely with her enemies.
</p><p>Up to 21 September 1939 over 300 British and 1,225 neutral ships had been detained, with 66 of them having cargo confiscated. In many cases these cargoes proved useful for the Allies' own war effort – Contraband Control also intercepted a consignment of 2 tons of coffee destined for Germany, where the population had long been reduced to drinking substitutes not made from coffee beans at all. When the manifest of the Danish ship <i>Danmark</i>, operated by the Halal Shipping Company Ltd, was inspected, the recipient was listed as none other than "Herr Hitler, President Republique Grand Allemagne".<sup id="cite_ref-TWI-28Oct39_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWI-28Oct39-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> From the beginning of the war to the beginning of October the daily average number of <a href="/wiki/Neutrality_(international_relations)" class="mw-redirect" title="Neutrality (international relations)">neutral</a> ships stopping voluntarily at Weymouth was 20, out of which 74, carrying 513,000 tons, were examined; 90,300 tons of contraband iron ore, wheat, fuel oil, petrol and <a href="/wiki/Manganese" title="Manganese">manganese</a> were seized.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Even more was done at the other two contraband stations at Orkney and Kent.

<p>At the beginning of the war, Germany possessed 60 U-boats, but was building new vessels quickly and would have over 140 by the summer of 1940. While Britain could call on impressive flotillas of battleships and cruisers for direct ship to ship confrontations, these heavy vessels were of limited use against U Boats. Britain now retained less than half the total of 339 destroyers she had at the height of the battle in 1917 when the U-boats almost forced Britain to consider surrender.
</p><p>Orders were immediately placed for 58 of a new type of small escort vessel called the <a href="/wiki/Corvette" title="Corvette">corvette</a> which could be built in 12 months or less. Motor launches of new Admiralty design were brought into service for coastal work, and later, a larger improved version of the corvette, the <a href="/wiki/Frigate" title="Frigate">frigate</a> was laid down. To free up destroyers for oceangoing and actual combat operations, merchant ships were converted and armed for escort work, while French ships were also fitted with <a href="/wiki/ASDIC" class="mw-redirect" title="ASDIC">ASDIC</a> sets which enabled them to detect the presence of a submerged U Boat.
</p><p>The massive expansion of ship building stretched British shipbuilding capacity – including its Canadian yards – to the limit. The building or completion of ships that would not be finished until after 1940 was scaled back or suspended in favour or ships that could be completed quickly, while the commissioning into the fleet of a series of four new aircraft carriers of the <a href="/wiki/Illustrious-class_aircraft_carrier" title="Illustrious-class aircraft carrier"><i>Illustrious</i> class</a>, ordered under an emergency review in 1936 and which were all finished or near completion, was delayed until later in the war in favour of more immediately useful vessels. Great efforts went into finishing the new battleships <a href="/wiki/HMS_King_George_V_(41)" title="HMS King George V (41)"><i>King George V</i></a> and <a href="/wiki/HMS_Prince_of_Wales_(53)" title="HMS Prince of Wales (53)"><i>Prince of Wales</i></a> before the <i>Bismarck</i> could be completed and begin attacking Allied convoys, while the French also strained to complete similarly advanced battleships, the <a href="/wiki/French_battleship_Richelieu" title="French battleship Richelieu"><i>Richelieu</i></a> and the <a href="/wiki/French_battleship_Jean_Bart_(1940)" title="French battleship Jean Bart (1940)"><i>Jean Bart</i></a> by the autumn of 1940 to meet the Mediterranean threat of <a href="/wiki/Littorio-class_battleship" title="Littorio-class battleship">two Italian battleships nearing completion</a>.
</p><p>To bridge the gap during the first crucial weeks while the auxiliary anti-submarine craft were prepared, aircraft carriers were used to escort the numerous unprotected craft approaching British shores. However this strategy proved costly; the new carrier <a href="/wiki/HMS_Ark_Royal_(91)" title="HMS Ark Royal (91)"><i>Ark Royal</i></a> was attacked by a U-boat on 14 September, and while it escaped, the old carrier <a href="/wiki/HMS_Courageous_(50)" title="HMS Courageous (50)"><i>Courageous</i></a> was not so lucky, being sunk a few days later with heavy loss of life. Ships leaving port could be provided with a limited protective screen from aircraft flying from land bases, but at this stage of the conflict, a '<a href="/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Gap" class="mw-redirect" title="Mid-Atlantic Gap">Mid-Atlantic Gap</a>', where convoys could not be provided with air cover existed. Churchill lamented the loss of <a href="/wiki/Berehaven" class="mw-redirect" title="Berehaven">Berehaven</a> and the other <a href="/wiki/Treaty_Ports_(Ireland)" title="Treaty Ports (Ireland)">Southern Irish ports</a>, greatly reducing the operational radius of the escorts, due to the determination of the Irish leader <a href="/wiki/%C3%89amon_de_Valera" title="Éamon de Valera">Éamon de Valera</a> to remain resolutely neutral in the conflict.
</p><p>In the first week of the war, Britain lost 65,000 tons of shipping; in the second week, 46,000 tons were lost, and in the third week 21,000 tons.
By the end of September 1939, regular ocean convoys were in operation, outward from the Thames and Liverpool, and inwards from Gibraltar, <a href="/wiki/Freetown" title="Freetown">Freetown</a> and Halifax. To make up the losses of merchant vessels and to allow for increased imports of war goods, negotiations began with neutral countries such as Norway and the Netherlands towards taking over their freighters on central government charter.

<p>Elsewhere, the blockade began to do its work. From Norway, across and down the North Sea, in the Channel and throughout the Mediterranean and Red Sea, Allied sea and air power began slowly to bleed away Germany's supplies. In the first 7 days of October alone, the British Contraband Control detained, either by confiscating neutral cargoes or capturing German ships, 13,800 tons of petrol, 2,500 tons of sulphur, 1,500 tons of jute (the raw material from which hessian and burlap cloth is made), 400 tons of textiles, 1,500 tons animal feed, 1,300 tons oils and fats, 1,200 tons of foodstuffs, 600 tons oilseeds, 570 tons copper, 430 tons of other ores and metals, 500 tons of phosphates, 320 tons of timber and various other quantities of chemicals, cotton, wool, hides and skins, rubber, silk, gums and resins, tanning material and ore crushing machinery.
</p><p>Two months into the war, the Ministry reintroduced the "Navicert" (<i>Navi</i>gational <i>Cert</i>ificate), first used to great effect during World War I. This system was in essence a commercial passport applied to goods before they were shipped, and was used on a wide scale. Possession of a Navicert proved that a consignment had already been passed as non-contraband by His Majesty's Ambassador in the country of origin and allowed the captain to pass Contraband Control patrols and ports without being stopped, sparing the navy and the Ministry the trouble of tracking the shipment. Violators, however, could expect harsh treatment. They could be threatened with Bunker Control measures, refused further certification or have their cargo or their vessel impounded. Conversely, neutrals who went out of their way to co-operate with the measures could expect "favoured nation" status, and have their ships given priority for approval. Italy, though an ally of Hitler, had not yet joined the war, and its captains enjoyed much faster turnarounds by following the Navicert system than the Americans, who largely refused to accept its legitimacy.

<p>During the early months of the war&#160;&#8211;&#32;the <a href="/wiki/Phoney_War" title="Phoney War">Phoney War</a>&#160;&#8211;&#32;the only place where there was substantial fighting was at sea.<sup id="cite_ref-WSC-TwilightWar_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-TwilightWar-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> News of the successes achieved by the men of Contraband Control were rarely out of the newspapers, and provided useful propaganda to shore up civilian morale. In the first 15 weeks of the war the Allies claimed to have taken 870,000 tons of goods, equal to 10% of Germany's normal imports for an entire year. This included 28&#160;million US gallons (110,000&#160;m<sup>3</sup>) of petrol and enough animal hides for 5 million pairs of boots, and did not take account of the loss to Germany from goods that had not been shipped at all for fear of seizure.
</p><p>German preparations to counter the effects of the military and economic war were much more severe than in Britain. On 4 September a tax of 50% was placed on beer and tobacco, and income tax went up to 50%. For months previously, all able-bodied people in cities had by law to carry out war work such as filling sandbags for defenses and air-raid shelters, and it was now made an offense to ask for a raise in salary or to demand extra pay for overtime.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-9Oct39_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-9Oct39-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> On 7 September wide-ranging new powers were granted to <a href="/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler" title="Heinrich Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> to punish the populace for 'Endangering the defensive power of the German people'; the next day a worker was shot for refusing to take part in defensive work.<sup id="cite_ref-BerlinDiary_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BerlinDiary-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> The new legislation, frequently enforced by the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Court_(Germany)" title="People&#39;s Court (Germany)">Peoples Court</a>, was made deliberately vague to cover a variety of situations, and could be very severe. In time it would lead to the death penalty for such crimes as forging food coupons and protesting against the administration. Shirer recorded in his diary on 15 September that the blockade was already having a direct effect. It had cut Germany off from 50% of her normal imports of nickel, cotton, tin, oil and rubber, and since the war's beginning she had also lost access to French iron ore, making her extremely reliant on Sweden for this vital material.
</p><p>Germany now looked to Romania for a large part of the oil she needed and to Soviet Union for a wide range of commodities. Apart from allowing Hitler to secure his eastern borders and annihilate Poland, the Nazi-Soviet Pact brought Germany considerable <a href="/wiki/German-Soviet_Commercial_Agreement_(1939)" class="mw-redirect" title="German-Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)">economic benefits</a> in August 1939. As well as providing refueling and repair facilities for German U-boats and other vessels at its remote Arctic port of <a href="/wiki/Teriberka" title="Teriberka">Teriberka</a>, east of <a href="/wiki/Murmansk" title="Murmansk">Murmansk</a>, the Soviets – "Belligerent Neutrals" in Churchill's words – also accepted large quantities of wheat, tin, petrol and rubber from America into its ports in the Arctic and Black Sea and, rather than transport them over the entire continent, released identical volumes of the same material to Germany in the west. Before the war total US exports to Soviet Union were estimated as less than £1 million per month; by this stage, they were known to exceed £2 million per month. From the outset, although they had formerly been hated enemies, large-scale direct trade took place between the two countries because both were able to offer something the other wanted.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise+Fall_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rise+Fall-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Germany lacked the natural resources Soviet Union had in abundance, whereas Soviet Union was at that time still a relatively backward country in want of the latest technology. However, by the end of December 1939 the Soviets didn't agree to start sending raw materiel since they weren't satisfied by German offers, citing refusal to get some of what they wanted and overly high prices on everyone else, and the actual trade within the framework treaty signed in August only took off in 1940 (see below).
</p><p>The Germans maintained an aggressive strategy at sea in order to press home their own blockade of the Allies. <a href="/wiki/Lloyd%27s_List" title="Lloyd&#39;s List">Lloyd's List</a> showed that by the end of 1939 they had sunk 249 ships by U-boat, air attack, or by mines. These losses included 112 British and 12 French vessels, but also demonstrated the disproportionate rate of loss by neutral nations. Norway, a great seafaring nation since the days of the <a href="/wiki/Vikings" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> had lost almost half its fleet in World War I, yet now possessed a merchant navy of some 2,000 ships, with <a href="/wiki/Tonnage" title="Tonnage">tonnage</a> exceeded only by Britain, the US, and Japan. They had already lost 23 ships, with many more attacked and dozens of sailors killed, while Sweden, Germany's main provider of iron ore, had lost 19 ships, Denmark 9, and Belgium 3. The Netherlands, with 75% of her commercial shipping outgoing from <a href="/wiki/Port_of_Rotterdam" title="Port of Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> to Germany, had also lost 7 ships, yet all these countries continued to trade with Germany. Churchill was endlessly frustrated and bemused by the refusal of the neutrals to openly differentiate between the British and German methods of waging the sea war, and by their determination to maintain pre-war patterns of trade, but stopped short of condemning them, believing that events would eventually prove the Allies to be in the right. He commented;

<p>The neutral commerce which Churchill found most perplexing was the <a href="/wiki/Swedish_iron_ore_during_World_War_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Swedish iron ore during World War II">Swedish iron ore trade</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-WSC-TwilightWar_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-TwilightWar-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Sweden provided Germany with 9m tons of high grade ore per year via its Baltic ports, without which German armaments manufacture would be paralyzed. These ports froze in the winter, but an alternative route was available from the Norwegian port of Narvik from which the ore was transported down a partially hidden sea lane (which Churchill called the Norwegian Corridor) between the shoreline and the Skjaergaard (Skjærgård), a continuous chain of some 50,000 glacially formed skerries (small uninhabited islands), sea stacks and rocks running the entire 1,600&#160;km length of the west coast. As in World War I, the Germans used the Norwegian Corridor to travel inside the 3-nautical-mile (5.6&#160;km)-wide neutral waters where the Royal Navy and RAF were unable to attack them. Churchill considered this to be the "greatest impediment to the blockade", and continually pressed for the mining of the Skjaergaard to force the German ships to come out into the open seas where Contraband Control could deal with them, but the Norwegians, not wishing to antagonise the Germans, steadfastly refused to allow it.
</p><p>Even so, by early October the Allies were growing increasingly confident at the effectiveness of their blockade and the apparent success of the recently introduced convoy system. A convoy of 15 freighters arrived in British ports unscathed from Canada bringing half a million bushels of wheat, while in France more important ships arrived from <a href="/wiki/City_of_Halifax" class="mw-redirect" title="City of Halifax">Halifax</a> in another convoyed group. The French claimed that of 30 U-boats sent out in Germany's first major offensive against Allied shipping, a third had been destroyed, and Churchill declared that Britain had seized 150,000 more tons of contraband than was lost by torpedoing.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-9Oct39_27-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-9Oct39-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> In mid-October <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> called for fiercer action by his U-boat crews and the <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> to enforce his counter-blockade, and warned the Allies of his new "secret weapon". Neutral ships were warned against joining Allied convoys, Scandinavian merchants were ordered to use the Kiel Canal to facilitate the German's own Contraband Control and the US <i>City of Flint</i>, which had rescued survivors of the <i>Athenia</i> became the first American ship captured as prize of war by the Germans, although the episode proved farcical and the ship was eventually returned to its owners.

<p>Hitler's "secret weapon" of the time was the <a href="/wiki/Magnetic_mine" class="mw-redirect" title="Magnetic mine">magnetic mine</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-WSC-TwilightWar_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-TwilightWar-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The Germans had used mines against freighters from the beginning, but now began laying a new type, which did not need to make contact with a ship to destroy it, off the English coast, using <a href="/wiki/Seaplane" title="Seaplane">seaplanes</a> to drop them in British harbours, channels and estuaries too narrow or shallow for submarines to navigate. They ranged from small 200&#160;lb (91&#160;kg) mines dropped dozens at a time to large one-ton versions dropped by parachute on <a href="/wiki/Shoal" title="Shoal">shoal</a> bottoms which were almost impossible to sweep, equipped with magnetic triggers activated by a steel hull passing above. Over the next few days many ships of all sizes blew up in waters close to shore, mostly by explosions under or near the <a href="/wiki/Keel" title="Keel">keels</a> although the waters had been swept. Six went down in the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Thames" class="mw-redirect" title="Thames">Thames</a>, and the new <a href="/wiki/Cruiser" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a> <a href="/wiki/HMS_Belfast_(C35)" class="mw-redirect" title="HMS Belfast (C35)"><i>Belfast</i></a> was badly damaged at the mouth of the <a href="/wiki/Firth_of_Forth" title="Firth of Forth">Firth of Forth</a>.
</p><p>The British urgently set to work to find a defence against the magnetic mine and began preparations to recreate the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Barrage" title="Northern Barrage">Northern Barrage</a>, established between Scotland and Norway in 1917 as a safeguard against increasing U-boat attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-WSC-TwilightWar_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-TwilightWar-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> In his war speech to the Empire, Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> declared: "Already we know the secret of the magnetic mine and we shall soon master it as we have already mastered the U-boat", but shortly afterwards two more ships were sunk, bringing the week's total to 24. Evidence that at least part of Germany's attack was with illegal floating mines came when a British freighter was sunk at anchor off an east coast port, when two mines came together and exploded off <a href="/wiki/Zeebrugge" title="Zeebrugge">Zeebrugge</a>, and when a large whale was found near four German mines on the Belgian coast with a huge hole in its belly.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-4Dec39_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-4Dec39-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Over the weekend of 18–21 November six other neutral ships were sunk off the English coast, including a 12,000 ton Japanese liner.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-9Oct39_27-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-9Oct39-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Eventually, a method of de-magnetising ships, known as <a href="/wiki/Degaussing#Ships&#39;_hulls" title="Degaussing">degaussing</a> was developed, which involved girding them in electric cable, and was quickly applied to all ships. Other means of minesweeping were also developed, whereby the mines were exploded by patrolling ships and aircraft fitted with a special fuse provocation apparatus.

<p>From early December 1939 the British began preventing German exports as a reprisal for the damage and loss of life caused by the German magnetic mines.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-4Dec39_32-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-4Dec39-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Chamberlain said that although he realised this would be detrimental to the neutrals, (Norway got nearly all its coal from Germany) the policy was in strict adherence to the rules of law and that whereas Germany's use of mines and submarine warfare had already caused many innocent deaths regardless of nationality, no loss of life had been caused by the exercise of British sea power. Before the war, 70% of Germany's export trade was with European countries, mostly the Netherlands, France and England, but the Ministry estimated that Germany's remaining annual exports were worth £44m to South America, £19m to the Far East, £15m to the US, and that although nothing could be done to prevent the overland exports to Scandinavia, Italy, Russia and the Balkans, it was believed that German sea trade could be reduced by 45% by the measure.
</p><p>Angry at the British export ban, the German Government accused the British of having deliberately sunk the <i>Simon Bolivar</i>, lost on 18 November with the loss of 120 people, including women and children. They advised neutrals to shun British waters and trade with Germany, declaring that because of the defensive minefields and contraband control, British waters were not mercantile fairways subject to the Hague Convention regulating sea warfare, but military areas where enemy ships of war must be attacked. Prompted by Germany, all the neutrals protested, but the overall effect was to slow the flow of neutral shipping to a standstill. The Nazi leadership later grew bullish at the apparent success of the mine strategy and admitted they were of German origin, stating that "our objectives are being achieved".
</p><p>In Berlin, William Shirer recorded in his diary that there were signs of a rush to convert currency into goods to guard against inflation, but that although the blockade now meant that the German diet was very limited, there was generally enough to eat and people were at that point rarely going hungry. However, it was no longer possible to entertain at home unless the guests brought their own food and though restaurants and cafes still traded they were now very expensive and crowded.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-4Dec39_32-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-4Dec39-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Pork, veal and beef were rare, but in the early months there was still adequate venison, wild pig and wildfowl shot on estates and in forests. Coal was now very difficult to obtain however, and although sufficient crayfish were imported from the Danubian nations to allow an enjoyable festive meal, people went cold that Christmas. In fact, Germany produced large volumes of very high quality coal in the <a href="/wiki/Saar_(river)" title="Saar (river)">Saar</a> region, but much of it was now being used to produce <a href="/wiki/Synthetic_rubber" title="Synthetic rubber">synthetic rubber</a>, oil and gas. There were reports that Germany, which badly needed to raise foreign currency had been trying to export bicycles and cars to adjacent countries without tyres. The average German worker worked for 10 hours a day 6 days a week; but although he may have had enough money to buy them, most items were not available, and shops displayed goods in their windows accompanied by a sign saying 'Not For Sale'<sup id="cite_ref-BerlinDiary_18-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BerlinDiary-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Time-16Dec40_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-16Dec40-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Such was the belief in the supreme strength of the Royal Navy that some thought that the blockade might now be so effective in restricting Germany's ability to fight that Hitler would be forced to come to the negotiation table.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Meanwhile, at the beginning of 1940 there were still 60 German merchant ships alone in South American harbours, costing £300,000 per month in port and harbour dues, and Hitler eventually ordered them all to try to make a break for home. Up to the end of February 1940 about 70 had tried to get away, but very few reached Germany. Most were sunk or scuttled, and at least eight foundered on rocks trying to negotiate the way down the unfamiliar and hazardous Norwegian coast. The Germans tended to prefer to sink the ships themselves rather than allow the Allies to capture them, even at risk to those aboard. Such was the case of the <i>Columbus</i>, Germany's third-largest liner at 32,581 tons, and the <i>Glucksburg</i>, which ran herself ashore on the coast of Spain when sighted. Another, the "Watussi", was sighted off the Cape by the <a href="/wiki/South_African_Air_Force" title="South African Air Force">South African Air Force</a> and the crew immediately set her on fire, trusting the aircrew to bring aid to the passengers and crew.
</p><p>That winter was harsh, causing the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> to freeze and heavy snow slowed rail transport, stalling Germany's grain and oil imports from Romania. The UK, having deprived Spain of her exports of iron ore to Germany entered into a deal to buy the ore instead via the <a href="/wiki/Bay_of_Biscay" title="Bay of Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, along with copper, mercury and lead to enable the Spanish, who were on the verge of famine, to raise the foreign exchange she needed to buy grain from South America to feed her people.

<p>On 17 January 1940 the <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_Economic_Warfare" title="Minister of Economic Warfare">Minister of Economic Warfare</a>, Ronald Cross said in a speech in the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">House of Commons</a>:
</p>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942"><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>We have made a good start, we must bear in mind that Germany does not have the same resources she had some 25 years ago. Her resources in gold and foreign currency are smaller; her stocks of industrial raw materials are far smaller. At the end of four and a half months, Germany is in something like the same economic stress she was in after two years of the last war.<sup id="cite_ref-HC-17Jan40_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HC-17Jan40-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite <a href="/wiki/Newsreel" title="Newsreel">newsreels</a> showing the effectiveness and power of the Nazi <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>, which even her enemies believed, Germany was unable to afford a prolonged war. In order to buy from abroad without credit or foreign exchange (cash), a nation needed goods or gold to offer, but the British export ban prevented her from raising revenue. In World War I, even after two years of war Germany still had gold reserves worth 2.5m marks and over 30 billion marks invested abroad, giving her easy access to exports.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> By this early stage of World War II, her gold reserves were down to around half a billion marks and her credit was almost nil, so any imports had to be paid for by barter, as with the high-technology equipment sent to Russia or coal to Italy.

Although the Germans had been able to find numerous ways of beating the blockade, shortages were now so severe that on 30 March 1940, when he was gearing up for his renewed <a href="/wiki/Blitzkrieg" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a> in the west, Hitler ordered that delivery of goods in payment to Russia should take priority even over those to his own armed forces. After the fall of France Hitler, intending to invade Russia the following year, declared that the trade need continue only until the spring of 1941, after which the Nazis intended to take all they needed.<sup id="cite_ref-Rise+Fall_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rise+Fall-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>As more U-boats were commissioned into the German navy, the terrible toll on neutral merchant shipping intensified. After the first 6 months of the war, Norway had lost 49 ships with 327 men dead; Denmark 19 ships for 225 sailors killed and Sweden 32 ships for 243 men lost. In early March, <a href="/wiki/Admiral_Raeder" class="mw-redirect" title="Admiral Raeder">Admiral Raeder</a> was interviewed by an American correspondent from <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> regarding the alleged use of unrestrained submarine warfare. Raeder maintained that because the British blockade was illegal, the Germans were entitled to respond with "similar methods", and that because the British government had armed many of its merchant ships and used civilians to man coastal patrol vessels and minesweepers, any British ship sighted was considered a legitimate target. Raeder said that neutrals would only be liable to attack if they behaved as belligerents i.e. by zig-zagging or navigating without lights. The paradox with this argument – as the neutral countries were quick to point out – was that Germany was benefiting from the very same maritime activity they were trying so hard to destroy.
</p><p>On 6 April, after the sinking of the Norwegian mail steamer <i>Mira</i>, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Professor Koht, referring to 21 protests made to belligerents about breaches to her neutrality, made a statement about the German sinking of Norwegian ships by U-boats and aircraft.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> "We cannot understand how men of the German forces can find such a practice in accordance with their honour or humanitarian feelings". A few hours later another ship, the <i>Navarra</i> was torpedoed without warning, with the loss of 12 Norwegian seamen, by a U-boat which did not stop to pick up survivors.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Intensification_of_the_blockade">Intensification of the blockade</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Blockade_of_Germany_(1939%E2%80%931945)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Intensification of the blockade">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Despite impressive statistics of the quantities of contraband captured, by the spring of 1940 the optimism of the British government over the success of the blockade appeared premature and a feeling developed that Germany was managing to maintain and even increase imports. Although the MEW tried to prevent it, neighbouring neutral countries continued to trade with Germany. In some cases, as with the crucial Swedish iron ore trade, it was done openly, but elsewhere, neutrals secretly acted as a conduit for supplies of materials that would otherwise be confiscated if sent directly to Germany.
</p><p>A third of Dutchmen derived their livelihood from German trade, and Dutch traders were long suspected of acting as middle men in the supply of copper, tin, oil and <a href="/wiki/Industrial_diamond" class="mw-redirect" title="Industrial diamond">industrial diamonds</a> from America. Official figures showed that in the first 5 months of war, the Netherlands' imports of key materials from the US increased by £4.25m, but also Norway's purchases in the same area increased threefold to £3m a year, Sweden's by £5m and Switzerland's by £2m. Prominent in these purchases were cotton, petrol, iron, steel and copper – materials essential for waging war. While some increases may have been inflationary, some from a desire to build up their own armed forces or to stockpile reserves, it was exactly the type of activity the Ministry was trying to prevent.
</p><p>American companies were prevented from openly supplying arms to belligerents by the Neutrality Acts, (an amendment was made on 21 September in the form of <a href="/wiki/Cash_and_carry_(World_War_II)" title="Cash and carry (World War II)">Cash and Carry</a>) but no restrictions applied to raw materials. During the last 4 months of 1939, exports from the US to the 13 states capable of acting as middlemen to Germany amounted to £52m compared to £35m for the same period in 1938. By contrast, Britain and France spent £67m and £60m in the same periods respectively, and according to a writer in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_World_Telegram" class="mw-redirect" title="New York World Telegram">New York World Telegram</a>, exports to the 8 countries bordering Germany exceeded the loss of US exports previously sent directly to Germany.
</p><p>But by far the biggest hole in the blockade was in the Balkans. Together <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, Romania and Bulgaria annually exported to Germany a large part of their surplus oil, chromium, bauxite, <a href="/wiki/Pyrite" title="Pyrite">pyrites</a>, oil-bearing nuts, maize, wheat, meat and tobacco. Germany also made big purchases in Greece and Turkey and viewed the region as part of its supply hinterland. Before the war, Britain recognised Germany's special interest in the region and took a very small percentage of this market, but now, via the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation they used their financial power to compete in the Balkans, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, underselling and overbidding in markets to deprive Germany of goods, although Germany was so desperate to maintain supplies that they paid considerably over the normal market rate. As elsewhere, Germany paid in kind with military equipment, for which they were greatly aided with their acquisition of the Czech <a href="/wiki/%C5%A0koda_Works" title="Škoda Works">Skoda</a> armaments interests.
</p><p>Germany was almost entirely dependent on Hungary and Yugoslavia for bauxite, used in the production of <a href="/wiki/Duralumin" title="Duralumin">Duralumin</a>, a copper alloy of aluminium critical to aircraft production. The British attempted to stop the bauxite trade by sending undercover agents to blast the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Gate_(Danube)" class="mw-redirect" title="Iron Gate (Danube)">Iron Gate</a>, the narrow gorge where the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> cuts through the <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" title="Carpathian Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> by sailing a fleet of dynamite barges down the river, but the plan was prevented by Romanian police acting on a tip-off from the pro-German <a href="/wiki/Iron_Guard" title="Iron Guard">Iron Guard</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Despite their declared neutrality, the politically unstable Balkan nations found themselves in an uncomfortable position, surrounded by Germany to the North, Italy to the West and Soviet Union to the East, with little room to refuse German veiled threats that, unless they continued to supply what was requested, they would suffer the same fate as Poland. Romania, which had made considerable territorial gains after World War I, exported a large proportion of the oil from its Ploiești site to Britain, its main guarantor of national sovereignty. Romania's production was about equal to that of <a href="/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, ranked 16th producer in the US, then a major oil-producing nation. The largest refinery, Astra Română, processed two million tons of petroleum a year but, as Britain's fortunes waned from the beginning of 1940, Romania turned to Germany using its oil as a bargaining tool, hoping for protection from the Soviet Union. On 29 May 1940 it stopped sending its oil to Britain, and signed an arms and oil pact with Germany; Romania was soon providing half her oil needs. Britain was able to arrange alternative supplies with the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Anglo-Iranian_Oil_Agreement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement (page does not exist)">Anglo-Iranian Oil Agreement</a>, signed on 28 August 1940.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Anglo-French_Supreme_War_Council" title="Anglo-French Supreme War Council">British Supreme War Council</a> met in London on 28 March to discuss ways to intensify the blockade. According to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Economist" title="The Economist">The Economist</a></i>,<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous. (September 2012)">when?</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> in April 1940 the war was costing the UK£5m per day out of total government expenditure of £6.5 – 7m per day. This was during the phoney war, before the fighting on land and air had begun. The Prime Minister said that, while it was out of the question to purchase all exportable surpluses, concentration on certain selected commodities such as minerals, fats and oil could have a useful effect, and announced a deal for Britain to acquire the entire export surplus of whale oil from Norway. Later Britain signed the Anglo-Swiss Trade Deal, and negotiations for war trade agreements were also concluded with Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Commercial agreements were negotiated with Spain, Turkey, and Greece, aimed at limiting material to Germany.

<p>Chamberlain also indicated that steps were being taken to stop the Swedish iron ore trade, and a few days later the Norwegian coast was mined in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Wilfred" title="Operation Wilfred">Operation Wilfred</a>. But perhaps the most important measure taken at this time was the setting up of the <a href="/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive" title="Special Operations Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE). SOE's origins go back to March 1939 following the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. It was set up by Lord Halifax with funding from the Secret Vote authorised by Prime Minister Chamberlain. In July 1940 Winston Churchill asked the Lord President (Neville Chamberlain) to define its structure and the document held at Kew CAB66/1 Extract 2 thereafter became known as the Charter of SOE. This Charter also defined the relationship of various organs of state including the security and police services with one another and initially the minister was the new Minister of Economic Warfare <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Dalton" title="Hugh Dalton">Hugh Dalton</a>. Though very few people knew of it at the time, the new organisation, the earlier version of which carried out the attempt to dynamite the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Gates" title="Iron Gates">Iron Gate</a> on the Danube, marked a new direction in the Economic War that would pay dividends later on, providing vital intelligence on potential strategic targets for the offensive bomber campaigns that came later in the war. There were turf wars from time to time with SIS who did not want to risk sources being compromised by SOE sabotage of enemy targets.

<p>The signing of the armistice with France in the <a href="/wiki/Compi%C3%A8gne_Forest" class="mw-redirect" title="Compiègne Forest">Compiègne Forest</a> on 24 June 1940 greatly changed the conditions of the Economic War.

In early August Germans installed <a href="/wiki/Dover_Strait_coastal_guns" title="Dover Strait coastal guns">Dover Strait coastal guns</a>.
</p><p>From early July the German air force began attacking convoys in the English channel from its new bases and cross-channel guns shelled the Kentish coast in the opening stages of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Britain" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a>. On 17 August, following his inability to convince the British to make peace, Hitler announced a general blockade of the entire British Isles and gave the order to prepare for a full invasion of England codenamed <a href="/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion" title="Operation Sea Lion">Operation Sea Lion</a>.

On 20 August <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> announced a blockade of all British ports in the Mediterranean, and over the next few months the region would experience a sharp increase in fighting.
</p><p>Meanwhile, in Spain, which had still not recovered from her own <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">civil war</a> in which over one million died and which was in the grip of famine, General <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> continued to resist German attempts to persuade him to enter the war on the Axis side. Spain supplied Britain with iron ore from the Bay of Biscay, but, as a potential foe, she was a huge threat to British interests as she could easily restrict British naval access into the Mediterranean, either by shelling the <a href="/wiki/Rock_of_Gibraltar" title="Rock of Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a> or by allowing the Germans to lay siege to it from the mainland. Although Spain could gain the restoration of the rock itself and <a href="/wiki/Northern_Catalonia" title="Northern Catalonia">Catalonia under French administration</a>, Franco could see Britain was far from defeated and that British forces backed by its huge powerful navy would occupy the Canary Islands. At this point Franco saw that the Royal Navy had reduced the German navy in Norway to an impotent surface threat, the Luftwaffe had lost the Battle of Britain, the Royal Navy had destroyed much of the French fleet at <a href="/wiki/Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir" class="mw-redirect" title="Mers-el-Kébir">Mers-el-Kébir</a>, had also destroyed Italian battleships at <a href="/wiki/Taranto" title="Taranto">Taranto</a> and the British Army was routing the Italian army in North &amp; East Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup> Franco continued to play for time.

</p><p>American opinion was shocked at the fall of France and the previous <a href="/wiki/Isolationist" class="mw-redirect" title="Isolationist">isolationist</a> sentiment, which led to the Neutrality Acts from 1935 onwards, was slowly giving rise to a new realism. Roosevelt had already managed to negotiate an amendment to the acts on 21 September 1939, known as <a href="/wiki/Cash_and_carry_(World_War_II)" title="Cash and carry (World War II)">Cash and Carry</a>, which though in theory maintained America's impartiality, blatantly favoured Britain and her <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a>. Under the new plan, weapons could now be bought by any belligerent providing they paid up front and took responsibility for delivery, but whereas Germany had virtually no foreign exchange and was unable to transport much material across the Atlantic, Britain had large reserves of gold and foreign currency, and while U-boats would be a threat, the likelihood was that her vast navy would ensure that the majority of equipment safely delivered to port.

<p>Because of Germany's new proximity on the west European coastline and the decrease in shipping traffic, ships which would normally have been used for patrolling the high seas were diverted to more urgent tasks.<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> Britain discontinued its contraband control bases at Weymouth and The Downs and removed all but a skeleton staff from the control base at Kirkwall to continue searching the few ships bound for Sweden, Finland, Russia and her recently annexed Baltic satellites ( <a href="/wiki/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latvia" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lithuania" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> surrendered on 21 June 1940 ).
</p><p>The Navicert system was greatly extended, introducing compulsory Navicerts and ships' warrants in an attempt to prevent contraband being loaded in the first place.<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> Any consignment going to or from ports without a certificate of non-enemy origin and any ship without a ships Navicert became liable to seizure.
</p><p>The lost Dutch and Danish supplies of meat and dairy products were replaced by sources in Ireland and New Zealand. Canada held a whole year's surplus of wheat, while the U.S. reserve was estimated to be the greatest in history, but Britain was suffering very heavy shipping losses as a result of expanding U-boat numbers. Virtually all Dutch and Belgian ships not captured by the Germans joined the British merchant fleet, which together with the tonnage contributed by Norway and Denmark added about one-third to Britain's merchant marine, giving them a large surplus of vessels. To prevent the enemy gaining a route to acquire supplies, the occupied countries and the unoccupied (<a href="/wiki/Vichy_regime" class="mw-redirect" title="Vichy regime">Vichy</a>) French zone immediately became subject to the blockade, with severe shortages and extreme hardship quickly following.

<p>In course of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" title="Battle of France">Battle of France</a>, the Germans captured 2,000 tanks of various types, including the heavy French <a href="/wiki/Char_B1" title="Char B1">Char B1</a> and British <a href="/wiki/Matilda_II" title="Matilda II">Matildas</a>, 5,000 artillery pieces, 300,000 rifles and at least 4 million rounds of ammunition. These were all available to be reconditioned, cannibalised or stripped down for scrap by the men of <a href="/wiki/Organisation_Todt" title="Organisation Todt">Organisation Todt</a>. Despite attempts to transport it away before capture, occupied nations' gold reserves were also looted, along with huge numbers of artworks, many of which have never been recovered.
</p><p>Occupied countries were subjected to relentless, systematic requisitioning of anything Germany required or desired.<sup id="cite_ref-HL-9May44_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HL-9May44-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> This began with a vast physical looting, in which trains were requisitioned to carry to Germany all movable property such as captured weaponry, machinery, books, scientific instruments, art objects and furniture. As time went on other miscellaneous items such as clothing, soap, park benches, garden tools, bed linen and doorknobs were also taken. The looted goods were taken to Germany mainly by trains, which themselves were mostly kept by Germany.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Immediate steps were also taken towards the appropriation of the best of the conquered nation's food. Decrees were proclaimed to force farmers to sell their animals and existing food stores, and while in the beginning a percentage of each year's crop was negotiated as part of the <a href="/wiki/Armistice" title="Armistice">armistice terms</a>, later the seizures became much more random and all-encompassing. Next, a blatantly unfair artificial <a href="/wiki/Exchange_rate" title="Exchange rate">exchange rate</a> was announced (1 Reichsmark to 20 <a href="/wiki/Francs" class="mw-redirect" title="Francs">francs</a> in France) and practically valueless "Invasion Marks" brought into circulation, quickly inflating and devaluing the local currency. Later, German agents bought non-portable assets such as farms, <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a>, mines, factories and corporations. The individual <a href="/wiki/Central_banks" class="mw-redirect" title="Central banks">central banks</a> were forced to <a href="/wiki/Underwrite" class="mw-redirect" title="Underwrite">underwrite</a> and finance German industrial schemes, insurance transactions, gold and foreign exchange transfers etc.
</p><p>The Germans also gained the occupied country's natural resources and industrial capacity. In some cases these new resources were considerable, and were quickly reorganized for the Nazi war machine. The earlier acquisitions of Austria and Czechoslovakia yielded few natural resources apart from 4m annual tons of iron ore, a good proportion of Germany's need. Austria's iron and steel industry at <a href="/wiki/Graz" title="Graz">Graz</a>, and Czechoslovakia's heavy industry near <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>, which included the mighty Skoda munitions works at Pilsen were, though highly developed, as heavily reliant on imports of raw materials as Germany's. The conquest of Poland brought Germany half a million tons of oil per year and more <a href="/wiki/Zinc" title="Zinc">zinc</a> than it would ever need, and Luxembourg, though tiny, brought a well-organized iron and steel industry 1/7th as great as Germany's.
</p><p>Norway provided good stocks of <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a>, aluminum, copper, nickel and 1m annual pounds of <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, the chemical element used in the production of high speed steels and as a substitute for tungsten. It also allowed them to continue to ship high quality Swedish iron ore from the port of Narvik, the trade which Britain tried to prevent with <a href="/wiki/Operation_Wilfred" title="Operation Wilfred">Operation Wilfred</a>. In the Netherlands, they also acquired a large, high tech tin <a href="/wiki/Smelting" title="Smelting">smelter</a> in <a href="/wiki/Arnhem" title="Arnhem">Arnhem</a>, though the British, foreseeing the seizure, restricted the supply of raw tin leading up to the invasion, so the amount gained was only around a sixth of a year's supply (2,500 tons) for Germany.
</p><p>But by far the biggest prize was France. German memories of the <a href="/wiki/Versailles_Treaty" class="mw-redirect" title="Versailles Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a> and of the turbulent years of reparations, food shortages and high inflation during the years immediately after World War I caused wealthy France to be treated as a vast material resource to be bled dry, and her entire economy was geared towards meeting Germany's needs. Under the armistice conditions she had to pay the billeting costs of the occupying garrison and a daily occupation indemnity of 300 to 400 million francs. The occupied zone contained France's best industries, with a fifth of the world's iron ore in Lorraine, and 6% of its steel production capacity. Germany's heavily overburdened railway network was reinforced with 4,000 French locomotives, and 300,000 (over half) of her freight cars.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-42_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-42-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Unoccupied France ( <a href="/wiki/Zone_libre" title="Zone libre">Zone libre</a> ) was left with only the rubber industries and textile factories around <a href="/wiki/Lyon" title="Lyon">Lyon</a> and its considerable reserves of bauxite, which because of the British blockade ended up in German hands anyway, giving her abundant supplies of aluminum for aircraft production. Along with the copper and tin she received from Russia, Yugoslav copper, Greek <a href="/wiki/Antimony" title="Antimony">antimony</a> and chromium and its Balkan sources, Germany now had sufficient supplies of most metals and coal. She also had around 2/3 of Europe's industrial capacity but lacked the necessary raw materials to feed the plants, many of them working at low capacity or closed<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> because of RAF bombing, the general chaos and the flight of the populations.
</p><p>From the beginning of the war, Germany experienced massive labour shortages and as time went by the occupied nations labour forces were virtually enslaved, either to work in factories to supply the Reich or sent to Germany to work in the factories or farms there.<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> In Germany herself, there was a chronic shortage of men to work the fields and 30,000 agricultural labourers were brought in from Italy along with thousands of Polish slaves. The pre-war stockpiles of goods were running down and more ersatz substitutes were being used. In addition, Germany remained cut off by the blockade from oversea supplies, such as copper from Chile, nickel from Canada, tin and rubber from the <a href="/wiki/East_Indies" title="East Indies">East Indies</a>, manganese from India, tungsten from China, industrial diamonds from South Africa and cotton from Brazil. Germany's Axis partner Italy was now also subject to blockade and, heavily reliant on her for coal, became a net drain, but Hitler's main problem was oil, around 12.5m tons of which were needed per year for <a href="/wiki/Total_war" title="Total war">total war</a>. Besides the Rumanian supply, his own synthetic industry produced 600,000 tons per year, and another 530,000 came from Poland. Russia was known to have enormous reserves of oil and gas but had chronically underdeveloped extraction systems, and though there was talk of German engineers going to reorganize them, it would take around two years before large quantities would begin flowing.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-14Oct40_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-14Oct40-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Hitler's best chance of beating the blockade was by knocking Britain out of the war. By far Britain's best weapon was her navy, which not only enforced the blockade, but also, despite the attempts of the U-boats and aircraft, continued to largely control the seas and keep her supplied with most of her needs. Her vast empire gave her formidable resources to draw on, excellent foreign <a href="/wiki/Credit_facility" class="mw-redirect" title="Credit facility">credit facilities</a> and gold reserves, and British rationing was nowhere as severe as in Germany. The only rationing introduced immediately at the war's beginning was petrol. Bacon, butter and sugar followed on 8 January 1940, meat on 11 March, with tea and margarine in July. It was not until U-boat successes in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic" title="Battle of the Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> began severely restricting convoys in late 1940 that rationing became more widespread, and even then many workers and children still had school meals and work canteens to supplement their rations, which made a significant difference to the amount of food they actually received. Photographs of abundant fruit markets, butchers, fishmongers and grocers were placed in foreign publications to prove to American and Commonwealth readers that Britain was not, as the Nazis claimed, starving. Britain did rely on imports for a large proportion of its foodstuffs and, even with the widespread '<a href="/wiki/Dig_for_Victory" class="mw-redirect" title="Dig for Victory">Dig for Victory</a>' campaign and the use of women farm workers, could only produce around two-thirds of its needs.<sup id="cite_ref-Richards-Quick_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richards-Quick-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Prior to the start of <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a> (bombing of population centres), which eventually killed over 40,000 civilians but which gave British industry the breathing space it needed to provide the fighter aircraft and ammunition to hold off invasion, docks on the south coast such as <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Plymouth" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> were heavily damaged by German bombing raids; in response as much maritime traffic as possible was directed to the west and north. On 16 August the <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> claimed to have destroyed <a href="/wiki/Tilbury_Docks" class="mw-redirect" title="Tilbury Docks">Tilbury Docks</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Port_of_London" title="Port of London">Port of London</a>, which normally handled a million tons of cargo per week. To the Nazis' glee, the skipper of one Brazilian freighter stated that southern Britain was finished and nothing could save her,<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> but although the damage was severe, ships from all parts of the Empire, South America and the <a href="/wiki/Far_East" title="Far East">Far East</a> continued to unload food and war goods for Britain and to load cargoes for export. With no passenger trade, and with all Scandinavian and continental sea traffic suspended, the port was far less busy than normal, but as many as 35,000 men still filled the warehouses with grain, tobacco, flour, tea, rubber, sugar, meat, wool, timber and leather every day throughout August 1940. British aircraft factories, led by the Minister of Aircraft Production, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Beaverbrook" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a> worked around the clock to greatly increase production and prevent a collapse of the RAF. On 16 September <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine wrote "Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault.

</p><p>In an effort to force Britain into submission, the Luftwaffe concentrated its efforts on factories, ports, oil refineries and airfields. By mid-August the attacks were becoming increasingly co-ordinated and successful. On 24 August, at the height of the battle, bombers sent to attack Fighter Command installations and oil refineries on the outskirts of London killed civilians in houses in central London through a navigational error, although many believed the bombing was deliberate. In spite of opposition from the air ministry, Churchill ordered the bombing of <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> in retaliation,<sup id="cite_ref-WSC-CommonwealthAlone_49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-CommonwealthAlone-49">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> and that night the German capital was bombed for the first time, although there were no fatalities. Britons were pleased as it showed Britain was able to hit back, and the next day Berliners were reported to be stunned and disillusioned; Göring, who had said it would never happen, was ridiculed by both sides. When the bombing continued, the Nazi leadership ordered the Luftwaffe to begin bombing British cities on 7 September in the belief that this would damage civilian morale so much that Britain would sue for peace.<sup id="cite_ref-JHolland_15-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JHolland-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-WSC-CommonwealthAlone_49-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WSC-CommonwealthAlone-49">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Britain" title="Battle of Britain">Battle of Britain</a> raged throughout August and September 1940, but the Luftwaffe was unable to destroy the RAF to gain the air supremacy which was a prerequisite for the invasion.

<p>Despite Germany's industrial gains, food was another matter. Even in peace, Europe was unable to feed itself, and although Germany now held two-fifths of the green fields of Europe, Germans found that despite decrees forcing farmers to sell their produce and livestock and outright requisition, in terms of food the occupied lands represented a net drain on their resources that could not be made good.
</p><p>While <a href="/wiki/Denmark_in_World_War_II" title="Denmark in World War II">Denmark</a>, the "Larder of Europe", produced massive quantities of bacon, eggs and dairy products, this was heavily dependent on imports of fertilizer from Britain. Before very long, livestock was being slaughtered because of a lack of <a href="/wiki/Fodder" title="Fodder">fodder</a> – the pigs so undernourished that they broke their legs walking to slaughter. Danish farmers paid large taxes, and merchant sailors were driven to work as labourers in Germany because of the blockade. Likewise <a href="/wiki/Netherlands_in_World_War_II" title="Netherlands in World War II">the Netherlands</a>, with its 2.7m cattle, 650,000 sheep, half a million pigs, and huge surplus of butter, cheese, meat, milk, margarine and vegetable oils, depended on Britain for its animal fodder. Much of the arable land had been ruined by opening the <a href="/wiki/Dyke_(construction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Dyke (construction)">dikes</a> during the Nazi invasion and many farmers refused to sell the Germans cattle, but soon there was such a meat shortage that the authorities had to confiscate bootlegged dog-meat sausages. Because the Germans forced Dutch fishermen to return to port before dark there was also a shortage of fish, and although Dutch overseas possessions were among the world's main providers of tobacco, it could not breach the blockade. Steel, iron and wood were so hard to obtain that the work of rebuilding <a href="/wiki/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> came to a standstill.
</p><p>Life was particularly harsh in Poland. <a href="/wiki/Cholera" title="Cholera">Cholera</a> broke out in <a href="/wiki/Concentration_camp" class="mw-redirect" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a>, and mass public executions added to the estimated 3 million Poles already killed during the invasion. Thousands had already died of cold and from starvation during the first winter of the war and with its sugar beet, <a href="/wiki/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a> and wheat systematically stripped away, and with few farmers left on the land, conditions quickly grew worse. Norway, with extensive mountainous areas relied on imports for half its food and all its coal; shortages and hunger quickly affected Belgium which, despite being densely populated and producing only half its needs, was still subjected to the widespread confiscation of food.
</p><p>France, normally able to feed itself, now had an extra 5 million refugees from other countries to care for.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup> When the Germans stripped the farms of half a million horses and mules for their army, causing a large drop in agricultural productivity, they also took 11% of remaining food stocks, a million tons. The Germans held 1,500,000 French prisoners of war as hostages, feeding them on bread and soup so thin that grass was added to bulk it up, and most items were now heavily rationed, with a worker entitled to a daily diet of only 1,200 calories; many people rode bicycles into the countryside during the weekend to scavenge for food. German soldiers got double rations, but this was still only a modest daily diet, similar to that served to inmates in American prisons.

<p>The British blockade of the Mediterranean immediately cut Italy off from 80% of its imports. Essential items such as <a href="/wiki/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a>, flour and rice were severely rationed, leading to riots, and any farmer withholding his crops from compulsory storage could be imprisoned for a year. Following their disastrous <a href="/wiki/Greco-Italian_War" title="Greco-Italian War">invasion of Greece</a> from occupied Albania on 28 October 1940, Italian reserves of rubber, cotton, wool and other commodities began to dwindle, and the high prices charged by Germany to haul coal across the <a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a> from <a href="/wiki/Trieste" title="Trieste">Trieste</a> made heat a luxury. On 11 November Britain scored a major victory against the Italian navy at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Taranto" title="Battle of Taranto">Taranto</a>, which secured British supply lines in the Mediterranean.
</p><p>Even in the normally plentiful Balkan region there were now food shortages caused by an extremely hard winter in the east and flooding of the lower Danube which devastated the agricultural plains and prevented the planting of crops. In Romania, farm hands were still mobilized into the Army and, along with Hungary and Yugoslavia, she needed all the wheat that could be produced, but the Germans made heavy demands on them, backed up by threats.<sup id="cite_ref-Time-14Oct40_46-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Time-14Oct40-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>

After Italy's disastrous <a href="/wiki/Greco-Italian_War" title="Greco-Italian War">invasion of Greece</a> on 28 October the British intervened in accordance with the Anglo-Greek Mutual Aid Agreement, occupying Crete and establishing airfields within bombing distance of the Romanian oilfields. In late November Hungary and Romania signed the <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_Pact" title="Tripartite Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>, joining the <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a> and, although Yugoslavia initially refused to sign, Hitler now had control of the majority of the vast agricultural resources of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hungarian_Plain" title="Great Hungarian Plain">Great Hungarian Plain</a> and Romanian oilfields.
</p><p>Britain's <a href="/wiki/RAF_Bomber_Command" title="RAF Bomber Command">Bomber Command</a> continued to attack German strategic targets, but the task of bombing Germany was made much harder by the loss of the French airfields as it meant long flights over enemy-held territory before reaching the target.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-30_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-30-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> But the British at this point had no effective means of taking offensive action against the enemy, and began to look towards a renewed bomber strategy. After the German devastation of <a href="/wiki/Coventry" title="Coventry">Coventry</a>, the RAF raided oil refineries in <a href="/wiki/Mannheim" title="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> city centre on the night of 16–17 December. This was the first "area raid", but photography after the raid showed that most of the 300 bombers had missed the target, and that Bomber Command lacked the means of carrying out precision raids. Even so, a bombing campaign offered the only hope of damaging the German economy,<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> and directives at the end of 1940 stated two objectives: precision attack on German production of synthetic oil, and an attack on German morale by targeting industrial sites in large cities. In December 1940 Roosevelt, having won an historic third term as president declared that the U.S. would become the "<a href="/wiki/Arsenal_of_Democracy" title="Arsenal of Democracy">Arsenal of Democracy</a>", providing the weapons Britain and her Commonwealth needed without entering the war herself.
</p><p>As 1940 drew to a close, the situation for many of Europe's 525 million people was dire.

The Italians were also buckling under a strong British and Indian counter-offensive in <a href="/wiki/Eritrea" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a> in East Africa. Because of its strategic position in the Mediterranean close to <a href="/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and the Axis shipping lanes, the British island of <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a> also came under daily enemy bombardment in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)" title="Siege of Malta (World War II)">Siege of Malta</a>, and by the end of the year the island had suffered over 1,000 bombing attacks to force a surrender.

<p>In January Herbert Hoover's National Committee on Food for the Small Democracies presented the exiled Belgian Government in London with a plan he had agreed with the German authorities to set up soup kitchens in Belgium to feed several million destitute people.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">&#91;53&#93;</a></sup> Under the plan, the Germans agreed to supply 1m <a href="/wiki/Bushel" title="Bushel">bushels</a> (1 US bushel = 8 US gallons, about 27&#160;kg for wheat) of bread grains each month, and the committee was to provide 20,000 tons of fats, soup stock and children's food. However, Britain refused to allow this aid through their blockade. Their view, which many in America and the occupied countries supported, was that it was Germany's responsibility to feed and provide for the people she conquered,<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">&#91;54&#93;</a></sup> and that the plan could not avoid indirectly helping Germany; if aid were given, this would free German goods for use elsewhere.
</p><p>Hoover said that his information indicated that the Belgian ration was already down to 960 calories – less than half the amount necessary to sustain life – and that many children were already so weak they could no longer attend school, but the British disputed this. Even so, many Americans were appalled by the continuing hardship. There were 16m French Americans alone, and by early March at least 15 different organizations – collectively known as the Coordinating Council for French Relief – were distributing aid in France through The American Friends Service Committee, while the Quaker Committee also distributed around $50,000 worth of food, clothing and medical supplies a month throughout France. The <a href="/wiki/American_Red_Cross" title="American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a> chartered a "mercy ship", SS <i>Cold Harbor</i> to take 12,000,000&#160;lb (5,400,000&#160;kg) of evaporated and powdered milk and 150,000 articles of children's clothing, 500,000 units of <a href="/wiki/Insulin" title="Insulin">insulin</a> and 20,000 bottles of <a href="/wiki/Vitamin" title="Vitamin">vitamins</a> to <a href="/wiki/Marseilles" class="mw-redirect" title="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> and shortly afterwards sent a second, the SS <i>Exmouth</i>, to carry $1.25m worth of relief supplies into unoccupied France.
</p><p>A number of prominent liberals denounced the release of food to France in a letter to <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="United States Secretary of State">United States Secretary of State</a> <a href="/wiki/Cordell_Hull" title="Cordell Hull">Cordell Hull</a>. Describing how French industry was working for the Germans and how Hitler had seized 1m tons of French wheat to hold in occupied France, the group believed the move would undermine the blockade and lead to Nazi demands for America to continue feeding other conquered lands. Vichy France's ambassador to the United States, <a href="/wiki/Gaston_Henry-Haye" title="Gaston Henry-Haye">Gaston Henry-Haye</a>, continued to press for a relaxation of the blockade on humanitarian grounds, and the US government found itself in a difficult moral dilemma. The US Foreign Affairs Economist Karl Brandt described how Hitler (and Stalin) used food as a political weapon to destroy internal opposition, reward accomplishment, punish failure and smash their enemies in neutral countries.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup> He described how the "warrior caste" were given the most, followed by essential workmen (in Berlin, William Shirer and the other foreign journalists were classed as "heavy labourers" and received double rations) while at the bottom prisoners, <a href="/wiki/Jews" title="Jews">Jews</a> and the insane got the least. By this time the Nazis had begun executing otherwise healthy mental patients in German institutions, in part to save on food, and there was a clamour from family members to have their loved ones removed.<sup id="cite_ref-BerlinDiary_18-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BerlinDiary-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Brandt said:

<p>By this time there were increasing reports of <a href="/wiki/Vichy_French" class="mw-redirect" title="Vichy French">Vichy French</a> vessels in the Mediterranean running the British blockade from <a href="/wiki/North_African" class="mw-redirect" title="North African">North African</a> ports and ignoring the orders of the British Contraband Control to stop and submit to search.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> Vichy Vice-Premier <a href="/wiki/Admiral_Darlan" class="mw-redirect" title="Admiral Darlan">Admiral Darlan</a> declared that the Vichy merchant marine had so far brought through the blockade 7m bushels of grain, 363,000 tons of wine, 180,000 tons of peanut oil together with large amounts of fruit, sugar, cocoa, meat, fish and rum. Darlan, who during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_France" title="Battle of France">battle of France</a> had given Churchill the solemn pledge that the French navy would never surrender to Germany, claimed that the British were reluctant to risk a third bloody clash like those at <a href="/wiki/Dakar" title="Dakar">Dakar</a> and Oran, and that, while they had sunk seven unescorted French food ships, they had never sunk, or even stopped, a French ship escorted by warships.

<p>Despite the effects of her blockade, there was no debate about America's resolve to feed Britain herself, and she was able to, with record harvests. But Britain, having already sold £1 billion of her foreign investments and taken on another £3 billion in loans to pay for war materials was now feeling the financial strain of the war. On 11 March 1941 Roosevelt and Congress passed into law the programme of <a href="/wiki/Lend-Lease" title="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a>, which allowed for the sending of vast amounts of war material to Allied countries, and Churchill thanked the American nation for a 'new <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>'.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> Although America did not enter the war for another nine months, she could no longer claim to be completely neutral and Hitler immediately ordered U-boats to attack US vessels.

In early February 1941 the main exporting Plata nations (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia) held a conference in <a href="/wiki/Montevideo" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> to discuss ways of improving trade between themselves and the rest of the continent. Apart from some <a href="/wiki/Parana_pine" class="mw-redirect" title="Parana pine">Parana pine</a>, tea and cereals, there was very little inter-Plata trade, and delegates eventually agreed a number of measures, such as easier currency exchange rules, finance for poorer nations, improved transport links between countries – particularly those landlocked – and lower customs barriers in order to demonstrate that they were not entirely reliant on overseas trade and American dollars to survive.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>America also provided significant support, but while <a href="/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, only 50 miles (80&#160;km) from Asia across the <a href="/wiki/Bering_Strait" title="Bering Strait">Bering Strait</a> was the obvious route for transporting Lend-Lease equipment, it was remote from <a href="/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">Contiguous United States</a>. A land route across the roadless 800-mile (1,300&#160;km) expanse of Canada, long discussed, now became vital, and so on 8 March 1942 the American army began construction of the <a href="/wiki/Alcan_Highway" class="mw-redirect" title="Alcan Highway">Alcan Highway</a>, a 1,671-mile (2,689&#160;km) long stretch from <a href="/wiki/Dawson_Creek" title="Dawson Creek">Dawson Creek</a> in <a href="/wiki/British_Columbia" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, north-west through <a href="/wiki/Yukon_Territory" class="mw-redirect" title="Yukon Territory">Yukon Territory</a> to an existing road on the Canadian/Alaskan border. The highway also allowed the linking up of the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Staging_Route" title="Northwest Staging Route">Northwest Staging Route</a>, a series of rough Canadian airstrips and radio ranging stations built to convey aircraft from <a href="/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> and the Yukon to Soviet Union and China. In total the US provided Soviet Union with $11 billion worth of goods, including 4,800 <a href="/wiki/Grant_tank" class="mw-redirect" title="Grant tank">Grant</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sherman_tank" class="mw-redirect" title="Sherman tank">Sherman</a> tanks, 350,000 trucks, 50,000 <a href="/wiki/Jeep" title="Jeep">jeeps</a>, 7,300 <a href="/wiki/Airacobra" class="mw-redirect" title="Airacobra">Airacobra</a> fighter aircraft, and 3700 light and medium bombers. The Soviets also received 2.3 million tons of steel, 230,000 tons of aluminium, 2.6 million tons of petrol, 3.8 million tons of food and huge quantities of ammunition and explosives.
</p><p>The German attack on Soviet Union prompted the British to attempt an increase in bombing in the belief that the fighter defences would have been thinned out.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Attacks on oil targets remained a priority, and successful raids were mounted against <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bremen" title="Bremen">Bremen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kiel" title="Kiel">Kiel</a> in May, with Kiel suffering almost complete production losses.

Between May and December the RAF made 105 separate raids over Germany but were unable to make any inroads into industrial capacity and suffered heavy losses in the process.
</p><p>On 22 June 1941 Churchill proclaimed that Britain would bomb Germany night and day, in ever increasing numbers, but because of the size of Germany and because the fleet continued to be eroded by planes going overseas, Bomber Command remained too weak for effective attacks on the German war machine. The new directives called for attacks on rail transport in the Ruhr to disrupt German economy, but this was a stop gap policy; The planes were too small, carried too light a bomb load and navigation was also shown to be faulty.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-30_51-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-30-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> Following losses of 10% during a raid on 7 November the RAF was ordered to conserve and build up its forces for a spring offensive, by which time a new navigation aid known as <a href="/wiki/Gee_(navigation)" title="Gee (navigation)">GEE</a> would be available and the <a href="/wiki/Avro_Lancaster" title="Avro Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bomber would be entering service.

<p>On the morning of 7 December 1941 the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> launched a massive <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive</a> <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">strike against ships of the US Pacific Fleet</a> at its base at <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> with simultaneous invasions of the British possessions of <a href="/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Hong_Kong" title="Japanese occupation of Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Singapore" title="Japanese occupation of Singapore">Singapore</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya" title="Japanese occupation of Malaya">Malaya</a>. The next day the war became a truly global conflict as America joined the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> in the war against Japan, Germany and the other Axis powers. Like Germany, Japan was heavily deficient in natural resources, and since 1931 had become increasingly nationalistic, building up her military forces and embarking upon a series of ruthless conquests in <a href="/wiki/Manchuria" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, China and <a href="/wiki/French_Indochina" title="French Indochina">French Indochina</a> to create an empire. Amid increasing reports of atrocities committed by her forces in these lands, such as the <a href="/wiki/Nanking_Massacre" class="mw-redirect" title="Nanking Massacre">Nanking Massacre</a> and the use of poison gas, world opinion turned against Japan,<sup id="cite_ref-ConciseHistoryWWII_6-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ConciseHistoryWWII-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> and from 1938 America, Britain and other countries launched trade embargoes against her to restrict supplies of the raw materials she needed to wage war, such as oil, metals and rubber.
</p><p>But the sanctions did not curb Japan's imperialistic mood. Japan signed the <a href="/wiki/Tripartite_Pact" title="Tripartite Pact">Tripartite Pact</a> with Germany and Italy in September 1940 and, after the US ordered a total oil embargo on all "aggressor nations" on 1 August 1941, cutting Japan off from 90% of her oil supply, she looked to the huge reserves in the south Pacific and south east Asia, territories already largely under US, British and Dutch <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. Japan knew that she could not win a prolonged war against the '<a href="/wiki/Occidentalism" title="Occidentalism">Occidental Powers</a>',<sup id="cite_ref-ConciseHistoryWWII_6-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ConciseHistoryWWII-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> but hoped that by striking first at Pearl Harbor to knock out the American Pacific fleet then using her huge reserves of men and machines to occupy the territories she coveted while America was still unready for war, Britain was engaged in all-out struggle with Germany and the Netherlands was herself occupied, she could establish her empire and consolidate herself so firmly that although her enemies would attempt to batter at her defensive line they would eventually be forced to accept the new position and make peace on the basis of the new status quo. In the early months of the war Japan launched a series of stunning conquests in the region, among them <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burma" class="mw-redirect" title="Burma">Burma</a> and the <a href="/wiki/East_Indies" title="East Indies">East Indies</a>, and soon threatened Australia far to the south.
</p><p>Because she was an island, the blockade of Japan was a fairly straightforward matter of sinking the transport ships used to ferry materials from the occupied lands to the home islands, and remained a largely American affair.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">&#91;62&#93;</a></sup> The Japanese began with a barely adequate 6.1m merchant tons which American submarines and aircraft gradually whittled away until only 1.5m tons remained. The steady toll of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attrition" class="extiw" title="wikt:attrition">attrition</a> against her merchant marine was a major factor in Japan's eventual defeat, but the Allies agreed that the situation was far more complex with Germany, where a range of measures including strategic bombing would be required to achieve final victory.

<p>In December 1941 the United States joined the economic warfare system that the British had created and administered over the previous two years. The <a href="/wiki/Board_of_Economic_Warfare" title="Board of Economic Warfare">Board of Economic Warfare</a>, (BEW) which evolved from the earlier Economic Defense Board, was created by President Roosevelt on 17 December 1941. Under the chairmanship of <a href="/wiki/Vice_President" class="mw-redirect" title="Vice President">Vice President</a> <a href="/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace" title="Henry A. Wallace">Henry Wallace</a>, the new department was made responsible for the procurement and production of all imported materials necessary both to the war effort and the civilian economy. The Proclaimed List – a US equivalent to the British Statutory List – was compiled and, under British direction, the United States Commercial Corporation was formed to begin making <a href="/wiki/Preclusive_purchasing" title="Preclusive purchasing">preclusive purchases</a> of strategic materials such as chromium, nickel and manganese to supply future Allied needs and to prevent them from reaching the Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>From the start there was close co-operation between the parallel American and British agencies,<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> over economic warfare measures, intelligence gathering and the later Safehaven Program. The American Embassy in London acted as the base for the American BEW activities in Europe and was organized in March 1942, "to establish a more intimate liaison between the manifold economic warfare activities centered in the Ministry of Economic Warfare and comparable activities in the United States Government." BEW personnel sat on the Blockade Committee on equal terms with their British counterparts, undertaking the routine work of handling Navicerts, ships permits and defining contraband. The embassy division worked with MEW in the development of new war trade agreements and the re- negotiation of existing overseas purchase – supply contracts. Together they attempted to persuade the remaining neutrals – Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Switzerland, Ireland (and Argentina) – that by supplying Germany with the materials it needed they were prolonging the war, and over time a number of measures were tried to pressure these countries into reducing or ending trade with the Axis, with varying degrees of success.

<p>Like General Franco in Spain, Portuguese President <a href="/wiki/Antonio_de_Oliveira_Salazar" class="mw-redirect" title="Antonio de Oliveira Salazar">Antonio de Oliveira Salazar</a> was perceived as pro-Axis but walked a fine line between the two sides, who competed fiercely for Portuguese raw materials,<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> generating huge profits for her economy. Portugal provided Germany with direct overland exports of a wide range of commodities including rice, sugar, tobacco, wheat, <a href="/wiki/Potassium_chlorate" title="Potassium chlorate">potassium chlorate</a>, inflammable liquids and <a href="/wiki/Galipot" title="Galipot">yellow pitch</a>, and Portuguese merchants were also known to be sending industrial diamonds and <a href="/wiki/Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a> via Africa and South America. But by far the most important material Portugal had to offer was tungsten. <a href="/wiki/Tungsten_carbide" title="Tungsten carbide">Tungsten carbide</a> was a critical war commodity with numerous applications such as the production of heat-resistant steel, armour plate, armour-piercing shells and high-speed cutting tools. Portugal was Europe's leading supplier of tungsten (and <a href="/wiki/Scheelite" title="Scheelite">scheelite</a>, another member of the <a href="/wiki/Wolframite" title="Wolframite">wolframite</a> series of tungsten ore minerals), annually providing Germany with at least 2,000 metric tons between 1941 and mid-1944, about 60 percent of her total requirement.
</p><p>Britain was Portugal's largest trading partner and had the right to force her to fight on her side under a 500-year-old alliance, but allowed her to remain neutral; in return Portugal allowed credit when Britain was short of gold and escudos, so that by 1945 Britain owed Portugal £322 million. Germany was Portugal's second-largest trading partner, initially paying for exports with consumer goods, but after 1942 increasingly with looted gold, which the Allies warned was liable to confiscation after the war. Portugal also allowed Germany generous credit terms, partly because after the fall of France the presence of a direct land route enabled Germany to threaten Portugal with invasion if she curtailed critical exports. The Allies, who also bought Portuguese tungsten, believed that if they could persuade the Portuguese to stop selling the ore the German <a href="/wiki/Machine_tool" title="Machine tool">machine tool</a> industry would very quickly be crippled and she would be unable to continue to fight. Because Portugal depended on the U.S. for petroleum, coal and chemical supplies, the Allies' economic warfare agencies considered achieving their aim by embargoes, but hesitated because they also wanted access to Portuguese military bases on the <a href="/wiki/Azores" title="Azores">Azores</a>.

<p>Since before the war, pro-Nazi Spain had suffered chronic food shortages which were made worse by the blockade. The Allies used a variety of measures to keep Spain neutral, such as limiting her oil supply and making trade deals at critical times to provide her with much-needed foreign exchange to buy food from South America.<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> On 23 November 1940 Churchill wrote to Roosevelt to inform him that the <a href="/wiki/Peninsula" title="Peninsula">peninsula</a> was now near starvation point, and that a US offer to provide a month by month supply of food might be decisive in keeping Spain out of the war.
</p><p>Spanish companies did important aircraft work for the Germans, Spanish merchants furnished Germany with industrial diamonds and platinum,<sup id="cite_ref-US_National_Archives_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-US_National_Archives-65">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> and General Franco, still loyal to Hitler because of his support during the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">civil war</a>, continued to supply Germany with war materials, among them mercury and tungsten. Spain, the world's second-largest producer of tungsten after Portugal, provided Germany with 1,100 metric tons of the ore per year between 1941 and 1943 (between them Spain and Portugal provided 90% of Germany's annual 3500 tons requirement). As a result of Allied economic measures and German defeats, by 1943 Spain adopted a more genuinely neutral policy. The Allied strategy with Spain was identical to that of Portugal: buy enough tungsten to satisfy the export need and prevent the rest reaching the enemy by whatever means. Britain and the US again had the option of launching an oil embargo on Spain but hesitated for fear of pushing Franco to side with Germany militarily.

<p>The U.S. and Britain were sympathetic to Sweden's difficult position and of her attempts to maintain her neutrality and sovereignty by making important concessions to the Nazis, such as continuing to export timber and iron ore and by allowing the Germans use of their railway system, a privilege which was heavily abused. There was a general belief however, that Sweden went too far in accommodating the Nazi regime.<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> In particular, the U.S. abhorred the use of Swedish ships to transport the ore to Germany and of her allowing Germany to transport soldiers and war materials across Sweden and through the Baltic under Swedish naval protection. Sweden received very little by way of imports due to the various blockades, and the Allies tried to use offers of a relaxation to persuade her to reduce her assistance of Germany, which they believed was actively prolonging the war. Churchill himself believed that Sweden could be instrumental in defeating Germany and after the heavy German defeats at <a href="/wiki/Stalingrad" class="mw-redirect" title="Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk" title="Battle of Kursk">Kursk</a> in 1943 the Russians became vocal in calling on Sweden to do more to aid the Allies.

<p>Despite signing a military alliance with Britain and France in October 1939, Turkey, like Sweden, Spain and Portugal spent the war keeping both sides at arm's length while continuing to supply them with their war needs.<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> Despite the German occupation of the Balkans in spring 1941, no military action was taken against Turkey, who in October 1941 began selling Germany large quantities of <a href="/wiki/Chromite" title="Chromite">chromite ore</a> for the production of chromium. The Turkish chromite ore, which like tungsten was an irreplaceable and essential war material, was the only supply available to Germany, who paid using iron and steel products and manufactured goods in order to draw Turkey into her sphere of influence. Turkey still maintained its good relations with the US and Britain despite the trade, which the economic warfare agencies sought to minimize.
</p><p>Via its Commercial Corporation, the US engaged in a preclusive buying programme under British direction of its materials, particularly the chromite ore.

<p><a href="/wiki/Switzerland_during_World_War_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Switzerland during World War II">Switzerland during World War II</a> had the most complex relationship with Germany of all the neutral countries. Expecting hardship, the Swiss government spent heavily in the years prior to World War II on stockpiling food and buying armaments and, anticipating an invasion, kept its forces constantly <a href="/wiki/Mobilization" title="Mobilization">mobilised</a>. Following the Nazi conquests of mid 1940, the tiny landlocked nation of seven million people, which had remained resolutely neutral since 1815 found itself in a difficult position, with German officials controlling all gateways to the outside world. But despite veiled threats and the constantly strained relations between the two nations, Switzerland was of no strategic importance to Germany, and of far more use as a workshop. Although Swiss citizens largely rejected the Nazis and subscribed to the Internationalist view expressed by the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, in order to survive and continue to receive imports, Switzerland had little choice but to trade with Germany, for which she was paid largely in coal. Well-known companies such as <a href="/wiki/OC_Oerlikon" title="OC Oerlikon">Oerlikon-Bührle</a> provided guns, Autophon A.G. provided transmitting apparatus, and other companies exported coal-gas generators, ball bearings, bomb sights, ammunition, carbon black, timepieces and <a href="/wiki/Rayon" title="Rayon">rayon</a> for parachutes.
</p><p>Because of her geographic position and trade with Germany, Switzerland was subject to Allied blockade measures throughout, although she remained able to move imports and other exports such as sugar and <a href="/wiki/Benzene" title="Benzene">benzene</a> overland, mainly to Germany and other countries in the neutral zone. In December 1941 an attempt by the Swiss military to purchase American machine-gun cameras was blocked by Britain's refusal to grant a Navicert,<sup id="cite_ref-US_National_Archives_65-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-US_National_Archives-65">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> and in April 1942 the US Board of Economic Warfare considered quotas for Swiss imports from overseas sources, identifying Swiss commodities which might be bargained for. Firms such as the Fischer Steel and Iron Works at <a href="/wiki/Schaffhausen" title="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a> were added to the blacklists because of their exports, causing them to eventually curtail supply and remodel their plant.
</p><p>Despite the Allied sympathy with Switzerland's position, some individuals and companies actively supported the Nazi cause for financial or ideological reasons. In particular the Swiss were, and continue to be, criticised for the way they aided the shipment of Nazi funds abroad and provided banking facilities for the concealment of looted art treasures and gold, much of it stolen from Jews. In late 1943 safes at a Swiss bank at <a href="/wiki/Interlaken" title="Interlaken">Interlaken</a> were rented by high-ranking Germans to store funds. Later, high-ranking Nazi officials withdrew their deposits from German banks and transferred large sums to Swiss banks and to the Swedish Consulate at <a href="/wiki/Karlsruhe" title="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a>. Italian and Swiss press reports also stated that many leading Italians banked large sums in <a href="/wiki/Swiss_francs" class="mw-redirect" title="Swiss francs">Swiss francs</a> in banks in Switzerland. Swiss individuals and financial institutions also acted as third-party go-betweens for transactions by others, such as for contraband shipments of cotton to Italy from the United States via a Portuguese factory, and transactions took place in Zurich which facilitated the trade of <a href="/wiki/Mercury_(element)" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> between Japan and Spain. During World War II, <a href="/wiki/Zurich" class="mw-redirect" title="Zurich">Zurich</a> industrialist and armaments exporter <a href="/wiki/Emil_Georg_B%C3%BChrle" title="Emil Georg Bührle">Emil Georg Bührle</a> began amassing one of the twentieth century's <a href="/wiki/Foundation_E.G._B%C3%BChrle" class="mw-redirect" title="Foundation E.G.

However the collection of around 200 works, which includes medieval sculptures and masterpieces by <a href="/wiki/C%C3%A9zanne" class="mw-redirect" title="Cézanne">Cézanne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Renoir" class="mw-redirect" title="Renoir">Renoir</a> and <a href="/wiki/Van_Gogh" class="mw-redirect" title="Van Gogh">van Gogh</a> has been mired in controversy since the war because of the unclear provenance of some pieces, leading to the return of 13 paintings to the former French-Jewish owners or their families. (On 10 February 2008 the collection was subjected to what Zurich police declared to be "the biggest ever robbery committed in Switzerland and perhaps even Europe").<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">&#91;66&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>US files show that there was a belief that neutrals that traded with the Axis should be threatened with post-war reprisals, but although the Americans believed that the Swiss trade with Germany justified bombing her,<sup id="cite_ref-US_National_Archives_65-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-US_National_Archives-65">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> it was also thought that her exports should be cut down without endangering the work of the Red Cross and intelligence work underway in Switzerland. The <a href="/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross" title="International Committee of the Red Cross">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC), which was founded in 1863 in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, did a great deal of invaluable humanitarian work, particularly in the worst-affected occupied territories, for example Greece. The children's section of the ICRC sent vitamins, medicine and milk products for children, and in 1944 it was awarded its second <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for its work. Switzerland also provided asylum for <a href="/wiki/Refugees" class="mw-redirect" title="Refugees">refugees</a> and persecuted individuals such as Jews and foreign workers forced to work in Germany. Following the collapse of the Mussolini regime, thousands of escaped Allied <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">POWs</a> were given sanctuary and the crews of damaged Allied bombers (both sides regularly invaded Swiss airspace) returning from raids over Germany often put down in Swiss territory and were allowed refuge.
</p><p>Despite the German trade and various measures for food self-sufficiency, Switzerland eventually used up her food stockpiles and suffered severe shortages of fuel through lapses in the German coal supply, increasingly relying on her forests and <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectric_power" class="mw-redirect" title="Hydroelectric power">hydroelectric power</a>. To help keep her people supplied with imports, and despite having no shoreline, the Swiss government developed its own <a href="/wiki/Merchant_Marine_of_Switzerland" title="Merchant Marine of Switzerland">merchant marine</a>, acquiring several vessels that had been impounded for smuggling or withdrawal foreign flags.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

<p>At the start of 1942 the Allies were yet to achieve a major victory. February was an important month. The Germans sank 117 ships in the Atlantic during the first two months of the year, and in Russia Hitler was about to launch a huge offensive to take the Caucasus oilfields. On 9 February <a href="/wiki/Albert_Speer" title="Albert Speer">Albert Speer</a> became the new head of the German Armaments Ministry. Speer was an inspired choice by Hitler, performing better than could have been expected of him, expertly organising the resources at his disposal, ensuring the speedy repair of bomb-damaged factories and pushing productivity up month after month.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> On 14 February the British War Cabinet took the decision to adopt area bombing as a means of undermining civilian morale and on 22 February <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Harris_(RAF_officer)" class="mw-redirect" title="Arthur Harris (RAF officer)">Air Marshal Arthur Harris</a> was appointed head of Bomber Command. The long-awaited <a href="/wiki/Lancaster_bomber" class="mw-redirect" title="Lancaster bomber">Lancaster bomber</a> was at last being delivered to squadrons, along with the new navigational aid <a href="/wiki/Gee_(navigation)" title="Gee (navigation)">GEE</a>.
</p><p>The renewed campaign got under way in early March with a "saturation raid" by 200 RAF aircraft on the <a href="/wiki/Renault" title="Renault">Renault</a> truck and tank works at <a href="/wiki/Boulogne-Billancourt" title="Boulogne-Billancourt">Boulogne-Billancourt</a>, near Paris. 623 French people were killed, mostly workers who had gathered outside to cheer the accurate hits.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-42_45-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-42-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup> This was followed by the first of a series of eight raids on <a href="/wiki/Essen" title="Essen">Essen</a> which proved a great disappointment. Despite an initial <a href="/wiki/Pathfinder_(RAF)" title="Pathfinder (RAF)">pathfinding</a> force being sent to light up the target area with flares, only one bomb in 20 fell within five miles (8&#160;km) of the town. On the night of 28–29 March the RAF used incendiaries for the first time to hit <a href="/wiki/L%C3%BCbeck" title="Lübeck">Lübeck</a>, an old town with many combustible buildings, but although the old town suffered a <a href="/wiki/Firestorm" title="Firestorm">firestorm</a>, production was back to normal a week later. More disaster followed on 17 April during a daylight "precision" raid on the <a href="/wiki/MAN_SE" title="MAN SE">MAN</a> diesel engine factory in Augsburg. There was little effect on production and, with no fighter cover, 7 of the 12 Lancaster bombers were lost, leading to a return to night bombing.

<p>Heavy investment had been made in building up the bomber force, but faith in its potential was beginning to wane, and Harris realised a major <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> success was vital to demonstrate his belief that bombers could be decisive in defeating the enemy.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Harris began pushing for a mass raid using the magic number of 1,000 bombers, although in fact the RAF barely had that many. At last, using every plane available including trainee crews, the RAF raided <a href="/wiki/Bombing_of_Cologne_in_World_War_II" title="Bombing of Cologne in World War II">Cologne</a> on 30/31 May 1942 with over 1,000 bombers; although over half the city was destroyed and it was seen as a success, the city made a surprising recovery. RAF assaults on medium-sized industrial towns to the east of the Rhine, the Ruhr and Berlin from mid-1942 also did little to weaken Germany economically. From July the <a href="/wiki/B-24_Liberator" class="mw-redirect" title="B-24 Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flying_Fortress" class="mw-redirect" title="Flying Fortress">Flying Fortress</a> fleets of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAAF) took on the role of daytime precision bombing of German arms and communication targets. They began by raiding airfields and railway stations in France and the Netherlands and badly damaged the <a href="/wiki/Heroya" class="mw-redirect" title="Heroya">Heroya</a> aluminium centre near <a href="/wiki/Trondheim" title="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> in Norway which produced synthetic <a href="/wiki/Cryolite" title="Cryolite">cryolite</a>, used in the manufacture of aluminium. From mid-November the RAF began a series of 16 massed night raids on Berlin, but though the damage was considerable, the raids were less effective than those on the Ruhr and Hamburg. Essen and Bremen also suffered 1,000 plane raids and upwards of 1,000 tons of bombs. In 1942 the RAF dropped 37,000 tons of bombs on German targets, probably three times the weight dropped on Britain in 1940 and early 1941.
</p><p>On 21 December 1942 the USAAF attacked the <a href="/wiki/Krupp" title="Krupp">Krupp</a> plant in <a href="/wiki/Essen" title="Essen">Essen</a> and, although they were unsuccessful at first, demonstrated their intention to paralyse German industry by concentrating on key sectors and persevering until lasting damage was inflicted.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Another important target was ball-bearing manufacture, most of which was concentrated at <a href="/wiki/Schweinfurt" title="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>, which in the months to come, despite the German deployment of smoke screens, mock factories, jamming devices, searchlights and <a href="/wiki/Flak" class="mw-redirect" title="Flak">flak</a> in the area received special attention from the USAAF; Albert Speer and <a href="/wiki/Erhard_Milch" title="Erhard Milch">Erhard Milch</a>, the Inspector-General of the Luftwaffe, realised that from this point onwards the writing was on the wall. On 25 February 1943 the Allies began a round-the-clock strategic bombing campaign in Europe, and a few days later Bomber Command began the 5-month long <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Ruhr" title="Battle of the Ruhr">Battle of the Ruhr</a>, a massive plan to wear down Germany's industrial capacity.

<p>Once new supplies of oil, rubber, and tungsten began flowing from the newly occupied Far East, mutually beneficial barter agreements were agreed whereby the Germans would acquire these vital commodities in exchange for the precision tools, blue prints and ball bearings which Japan badly needed.<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> There had already been some trading of <a href="/wiki/Silk" title="Silk">silk</a> products early in the European war. Despite the 5,600 miles (9,000&#160;km) and the land barrier of Russia separating Berlin from Tokyo, by mid-1942 a system of fast blockade runners was set up, the freighters traveling non-stop without showing lights or using their radio to avoid detection. The MEW believed that the first Japanese shipment of rubber reached Germany during the summer of 1942, having initially sailed from <a href="/wiki/Indo-China" class="mw-redirect" title="Indo-China">Indo-China</a> to West Africa. From there it was transferred to small coastal vessels and ran the blockade to French Mediterranean ports by night. The MEW became concerned at the "steady trickle" of Japanese blockade runners reaching Europe, which one estimate put at 15 ships by the end of 1942,<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> and on the anniversary of the German and Italian declarations of war on the US, <a href="/wiki/General_Tojo" class="mw-redirect" title="General Tojo">General Tojo</a> expressed his pleasure that Japan was able to contribute the resources captured in the South Pacific to the Axis cause.
</p><p>Other blockade runners were known to be arriving at the French port of Bordeaux, 70 miles inside the <a href="/wiki/Gironde_Estuary" class="mw-redirect" title="Gironde Estuary">Gironde Estuary</a> on the Atlantic coast. The port, also a base for German and Italian submarines, was one of the most heavily defended waterways in Europe, protected by numerous patrol boats, searchlights, shore batteries and thousands of troops. Because of its distance from the sea, a naval excursion was impossible, while the RAF believed that a bombing raid would be far too inaccurate and costly in civilian life and aircraft. The difficulty of stopping the blockade runners became known as the "Bordeaux Problem", and eventually the British decided that a different, more espionage based approach was needed.
</p><p>On 7 December 1942, <a href="/wiki/Combined_Operations_Headquarters" title="Combined Operations Headquarters">Combined Operations</a> launched one of the most famous raids of the war; <a href="/wiki/Operation_Frankton" title="Operation Frankton">Operation Frankton</a>, better known as the '<a href="/wiki/Cockleshell_Heroes" class="mw-redirect" title="Cockleshell Heroes">Cockleshell Heroes</a>' mission, in an attempt to sink the ships by sending a 12-man team of <a href="/wiki/Royal_Marine_Commandos" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal Marine Commandos">Royal Marine Commandos</a> to paddle up the Gironde in canoes to place delayed action bombs on their exposed hulls. Although the commandos displayed exceptional courage and the expedition was essentially successful in that a number of ships were damaged, only 2 men survived, including the leader, Major <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Hasler" title="Herbert Hasler">Herbert Hasler</a>, who had to make their way across 80 miles of France, Spain and Gibraltar back to safety. The remaining 10 men drowned, died of exposure or were captured and interrogated by the Germans before being executed.
</p><p>In addition, excessive secrecy and a lack of communication between <a href="/wiki/Whitehall" title="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> departments meant that at exactly the same time that Operation Frankton was under way, and without their knowledge, the SOE were in the final stages of their own attempt to destroy the blockade runners by deploying a team of French agents led by <a href="/wiki/Claude_de_Baissac" title="Claude de Baissac">Claude de Baissac</a>, posing as painting contractors who planned to carry explosives onto the ships in their baggage. The explosions caused by the commando mission ruined the preparations of the SOE team, who might well have achieved a far more effective destruction of the blockade running vessels but for the Combined Operations raid.
</p><p>Even so, the combined Allied air forces and navies eventually began to track down the blockade runners. In late 1942, an 8,000-ton cargo ship was caught in the Indian Ocean, where it hoisted a neutral flag and initially gave the name of a neutral vessel but misspelled the name. When the Allied warships opened fire the crew scuttled the ship, and 78 Germans were captured.
</p><p>By late 1943 the Germans became so desperate for supplies of key commodities that in one incident they sent a large destroyer force out into the Bay of Biscay to protect ships bringing a cargo into Bordeaux, and lost three vessels (<a href="/wiki/German_destroyer_Z27" title="German destroyer Z27"><i>Z27</i></a>, <a href="/wiki/German_torpedo_boat_T25" title="German torpedo boat T25"><i>T25</i></a> and <a href="/wiki/German_torpedo_boat_T26" title="German torpedo boat T26"><i>T26</i></a>) to Allied action (<a href="/wiki/Operation_Stonewall" title="Operation Stonewall">Operation Stonewall</a>). By May 1944, 15 blockade runners had been sunk and the traffic had virtually ceased apart from submarines carrying very small cargoes. The MEW stated that 45,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of tungsten, 17,000 tons of tin and 25,000 tons of vegetable oils had been destroyed as well as important far-Eastern drugs such as <a href="/wiki/Quinine" title="Quinine">quinine</a>. The Ministry was also of the view that the strong blockade had probably prevented further large amounts from being transported.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup>

<p>By early 1942, the food shortages in Greece, which had been invaded by the Germans in April 1941 along with Yugoslavia, and which was now subject to the blockade, reached the famine proportions foreseen by Hoover. With its economy and <a href="/wiki/Infrastructure" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a> ruined by the war with Italy, Greece was compelled to pay occupation costs and to grant Germany a "war loan", and was subjected to the same confiscation of food and raw materials practiced elsewhere. Using its virtually worthless "invasion marks", more than half of Greece's already inadequate wheat production was "sold" to Germany along with livestock, clothes, dried vegetables and fruit. Potatoes were fried using Greek olive oil and shipped back to Germany, and the tomato crop was hurried to <a href="/wiki/Scurvy" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>-ridden German troops in Africa. One US correspondent commented; "Germany worked like a pack of driver ants, picking Greece clean",<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup> but the corrupt, <a href="/wiki/Collaborationist" class="mw-redirect" title="Collaborationist">collaborationist</a> government also controlled the <a href="/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a> in whatever food was still available, causing rampant inflation of the <a href="/wiki/Modern_drachma" title="Modern drachma">drachma</a>, which saw the price of a loaf of bread, where available, reach $15. There were reports of grave-robbing by people desperate to find the money to feed their families, but in the towns there were none of the staple potatoes, figs, raisins or tomatoes available and it was not long before the population began to die in droves from hunger, cholera, typhoid and dysentery. In September 1941, the Greeks appealed for overseas aid, particularly from Turkey. An official declared "We are not asking for food that Turks would eat, but for food they refuse to eat."

<p>Despite past enmity between the two nations, Turkey quickly responded, chartering the <a href="/wiki/SS_Kurtulus" class="mw-redirect" title="SS Kurtulus">SS&#160;<i>Kurtulus</i></a> and, after receiving permission from the British, the ship sailed from <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> to <a href="/wiki/Piraeus" title="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> on 6 October with wheat, maize, vegetables, dried fruits and medicines. Over the next few months, the ship delivered around 6,700 tons of supplies to Greece, but foundered on rocks and sank during her fifth voyage. Despite the humanitarian efforts, by late January 1942 between 1,700 and 2,000 men, women and children were dying in <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a> and Piraeus each day, and Italy, which then occupied Greece, was forced to ship 10,000 tons of grain from her meagre domestic supplies, secretly to avoid unrest from her own people. This was still not enough, and eventually international pressure forced Britain to lift its blockade for the first time. In early February, <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Dalton" title="Hugh Dalton">Hugh Dalton</a> of MEW told the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons" title="House of Commons">House of Commons</a> that Britain and America would send 8,000 tons of wheat to Greece, although there was no guarantee that the relief supplies would find their way to the starving.

<p>1942–43 was another lean year for agriculture in France. Many fertile regions such as the <a href="/wiki/Vexin" title="Vexin">Vexin</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Beauce,_France" title="Beauce, France">Beauce</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Brie_(region)" title="Brie (region)">Brie</a> suffered seriously from drought. The wheat heads were light, straw was short and hay shrivelled in the meadows, causing a lack of animal fodder. In occupied areas, the Germans confiscated 40% of the crop as soon as it became available; the authorities took 40% for the wider population, leaving the farmer with only 20%. In <a href="/wiki/Normandy" title="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brittany" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> and along the Channel coast, rain spoilt the potato crop and tomatoes and beans did not mature. In other provinces, e.g., <a href="/wiki/Touraine" title="Touraine">Touraine</a> and Burgundy region, the very dry weather left vegetables and even weeds cooked in the ground so people who bred rabbits for meat had to feed them with tree leaves.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>South of the <a href="/wiki/Loire_(river)" class="mw-redirect" title="Loire (river)">Loire</a> the weather was more favourable but, with the coming threat of invasion, the Germans were intent on stripping the land so the Allies would be left with nothing and be compelled to bring everything across from England. Hermann Göring proclaimed in a speech that under the Nazi New Order, the <a href="/wiki/Herrenvolk" class="mw-redirect" title="Herrenvolk">Herrenvolk</a> were entitled to deprive the occupied peoples of their food, and that whoever starved it would not be the Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup> Rationing remained fierce. Even with coupons, it was impossible to acquire many items. Maximum prices were fixed for everything, but the black market pushed prices 5–15 times beyond the official tariff. Cheap restaurants in big towns served dishes comprising turnip or carrot tops made without any kind of fat, and although householders still received a fair ration of rough wine, all spirits were confiscated for industrial use.
</p><p>The MEW continued to receive requests for a partial relaxation of the blockade, often in the belief it would make no appreciable difference to the effect on the enemy, but the pleas were steadfastly refused. The MEW believed that any substantial or widespread relaxation of the blockade would inevitably be exploited by the enemy to his own advantage, and declared that they would "not give him that comfort".<sup id="cite_ref-UK_National_Archives_41-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UK_National_Archives-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>

German labour shortages grew so acute that Germany relied increasingly on slave labour and demanded prior claim on all available Swiss labour. The French collaborator <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Laval" title="Pierre Laval">Pierre Laval</a> promised to send 300,000 more workmen to Germany immediately.
</p><p>Sir Arthur Harris and his USAAF counterpart, Major General <a href="/wiki/Ira_Eaker" class="mw-redirect" title="Ira Eaker">Ira Eaker</a> assured Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt that Germany could be bombed out of the war by the end of 1943 on the condition that nothing was allowed to reduce the forces already allocated to the bombardment of Germany. Harris was known for his sharp tongue and lack of remorse for the German civilians being killed by the raids; one of his subordinates said of him. "Oh, we love him, he's so bloody inhuman."<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">&#91;72&#93;</a></sup> Harris believed that the only role for land forces in Europe would be to occupy the Continent after the bombing had defeated Germany. Churchill thought that the experiment of all-out bomber attack was worth trying as long as other measures were not excluded, and while the commanders of the Allied land forces and navies doubted that bombing would defeat Germany, they agreed that the raids would be useful in weakening Germany prior to the invasion of Europe. But only 10% of bombs fell close enough to their targets to be called hits, and heavily bombed installations often had to be bombed again to knock them out. However, attacks on the already strained German railway system did seriously affect military operations – in early 1943 around 150 locomotives and many freight cars were being destroyed each month.

The raid drowned 1,500 people and countless farm animals, but was not as successful as claimed; and half of the 18 bombers were shot down. On 24 July 1943 Hamburg, a major manufacturing centre for <a href="/wiki/Tiger_tank" title="Tiger tank">Tiger tanks</a> and <a href="/wiki/88mm_gun" class="mw-redirect" title="88mm gun">88mm guns</a> was virtually destroyed in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Gomorrah" class="mw-redirect" title="Operation Gomorrah">Operation Gomorrah</a>.

</p><p>In comparison with the RAF, the US 8th Air Force was at that point still small, having dropped less than a tenth the bomb tonnage on Germany as the RAF. But it was growing fast, and had begun to achieve good results. "Bomber" Harris had great faith in American manufacturing ability and believed that it would be the USAAF, not the RAF, who would eventually deliver the final decisive blows to the enemy. On 1 August the USAAF attacked the Romanian Ploiești oilfields in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Tidal_Wave" title="Operation Tidal Wave">Operation Tidal Wave</a> as part of the <a href="/wiki/Oil_Plan" class="mw-redirect" title="Oil Plan">Oil Plan</a> to wear down Axis oil supplies. No loss of production was caused, and losses were heavy: 54 out of 177 bombers were shot down. On 14 October 1943 the 8th USAAF carried out the most successful of 16 attacks on the Schweinfurt ball-bearing works but caused only a temporary setback to production and, because the bombers had fighter escort only part of the way, losses were again heavy. This forced a rethink on the self-defending bomber formation and the curtailment of daytime attacks. In November heavy damage was caused by the USAAF to the most important industrial site in Norway, the <a href="/wiki/Molybdenum" title="Molybdenum">molybdenum</a> mine at <a href="/wiki/Knaben" title="Knaben">Knaben</a>, 50 miles (80&#160;km) from <a href="/wiki/Stavanger" title="Stavanger">Stavanger</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">&#91;73&#93;</a></sup> A Norwegian smelting works was also destroyed by British and Norwegian commandos on 21 November 1943.

By late October 1943, the MEW believed that German productivity was down 30%,<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup> and that half the drop had occurred in the previous six months, but the figures showed the limitations of all bombing, saturation or precision. Many of the installations that had previously been reported as wiped out continued to operate.
</p><p>In early November the MEW published a summary of the position in the occupied lands, giving an assessment of what the Germans were believed to have appropriated from the territories they conquered in 1940 and 1941. The report estimated that more than $12,800,000,000 had been collected from the occupied territories in occupation costs and other direct charges and continued to be collected at a yearly rate of $4,800,000,000. Poland, the country most harshly treated, had suffered the confiscation of all state properties, all central stocks of textiles, food and livestock. 9,000 factories and 60,000 commercial enterprises were taken over for exploitation, and 80% of the 1942 harvest was sent to Germany. Czechoslovakia had lost its grain, its gold reserves, mines, heavy industries and important textile industry. Her total tribute was given as $1,200,000,000. Dutch industry was by now also under complete German control. State expenditures had almost trebled to pay Germany's occupation and other costs and levies. Belgium, whose government was in exile in Britain, had its entire $260,000,000 gold reserves surrendered by the Vichy regime and by the beginning of 1943 the country's entire stock of 1,500 locomotives and 75,000 trucks had been requisitioned. In Yugoslavia, all cars were seized in 1941, and any bicycles that could be found had been taken by 1942. The country had been partitioned and had suffered, like so many others from inflation caused by the occupation mark system. In Norway the Germans requisitioned personal property right down to woollen blankets, ski trousers and windproof jackets, and in Denmark all trade and industry of consequence was now controlled by Germans.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">&#91;75&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Troops had also begun seizing furniture and household goods to be shipped back for the use of bombed-out German families. Under Albert Speer, industrial factories were being relocated to Czechoslovakia on a considerable scale, and by the end of 1943, despite a lot of damage to towns – German figures showed that 6.9m people had been bombed out or evacuated – output of war material was greater than ever. In October 1943 the USAAF attacked Ploiești again, but according to German records total loss of petroleum to the end of 1943 had not exceeded 150,000 tons.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>

<p>By the beginning of 1944 it was clear that the bomber offensive had not delivered the decisive defeat that was promised, and preparations were well underway for the invasion of Europe.

The Spanish Minister for Industry and Commerce defended Spain's position, saying that Spain felt it impossible to deny Germany a commodity which had a very high value in wartime. Britain, who also made considerable purchases of Spanish tungsten, favoured a compromise that would allow Spain to maintain her German tungsten exports at the 1943 level, but the United States demanded a complete ban and the oil embargo was eventually reimposed. Spain agreed to reduce the German exports in May 1944, although the Allies discovered that she continued making clandestine shipments, transporting more than 800 tons of tungsten through to July 1944 and not finally ending the trade until the closing of the Franco-Spanish border in August 1944. Portugal also defended her right to neutral trade, fearing German reprisals such as invasion or the bombing of her cities and shipping if she ceased tungsten shipments; however the US Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Cordell_Hull" title="Cordell Hull">Cordell Hull</a> believed that he could have achieved the objective if he had had wholehearted British support.<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>

<p>On 20 February 1944 the USAAF began <a href="/wiki/Operation_Big_Week" class="mw-redirect" title="Operation Big Week">Operation 'Big Week'</a>, a plan to wear down the Luftwaffe arms base to secure Allied air superiority during the invasion. For six days aircraft factories were subjected to constant pounding, with the Americans flying heavily escorted missions against airframe manufacturing and assembly plants and other targets in numerous German cities including <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Brunswick, <a href="/wiki/Gotha" title="Gotha">Gotha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Regensburg" title="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Schweinfurt" title="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Augsburg" title="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Steyr" title="Steyr">Steyr</a>. The RAF returned to bomb the same targets by night, and the damage was such that Milch informed Speer that the March 1944 output would be only 30–40% of February's total. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Speer" title="Albert Speer">Albert Speer</a> took over aircraft production and managed to perform miracles: the installations were soon back to something like normal capacity, and overall production – including synthetic oil production – was at an all-time high and still rising. The Luftwaffe had around 40% more aircraft than it possessed a year earlier, the construction of new tanks was sufficient to equip new divisions raised for the defence of western Europe and to make good some of the losses in the east.<sup id="cite_ref-ConciseHistoryWWII_6-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ConciseHistoryWWII-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Although the Allies kept up the round-the-clock pressure, raiding countless lines-of-communications targets in the build-up to the invasion, they were slow to grasp what German commanders were all too aware of – that Germany had plenty of tanks and aircraft and their real achilles heel was the oil supply.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> In early March the USAAF raided the <a href="/wiki/Erkner" title="Erkner">Erkner</a> ball-bearing works, scoring 75 direct hits, stopping production for some time, and commenced the "<a href="/wiki/Plan_for_Completion_of_Combined_Bomber_Offensive" title="Plan for Completion of Combined Bomber Offensive">Plan for Completion of Combined Bomber Offensive</a>". The objective now became to halve Axis oil production by attacking the Ploiești oilfields and fourteen synthetic-oil plants in order to deprive Germany of the means to keep its military machines operational.
</p><p>On 12 May the USAAF hit East German synthetic oil plants at <a href="/wiki/Leuna" title="Leuna">Leuna</a>, <a href="/wiki/B%C3%B6hlen" title="Böhlen">Böhlen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zeitz" title="Zeitz">Zeitz</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lutzendorf&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lutzendorf (page does not exist)">Lutzendorf</a>; they were so badly damaged they could supply no oil for several weeks, being hit again later that month before they returned to production.

</p><p>Meanwhile, as a result of the sustained Allied diplomatic pressure, together with the deteriorating German military position, Sweden began to reduce its trade with Germany. But a September 1943 agreement under which she agreed to end ball-bearing exports failed to include a restriction on sales of the high-quality steel used in their manufacture; this allowed the restrictions to be largely by-passed, and the agreement ultimately had little effect on the German war industry. Allied attempts to stop Turkish sales of <a href="/wiki/Chromium" title="Chromium">chromium</a> had begun to have the desired effect, however. In November 1943 Albert Speer declared that without its Turkish chromium imports, Germany's armaments manufacture would come to a halt within 10 months, and Allied threats to subject Turkey to the same economic warfare measures used against other neutrals eventually persuaded her to cease the exports to Germany by April 1944.
</p><p>Though Germany, with the resources of the conquered territories was still able to produce three times as much steel as Britain,<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">&#91;76&#93;</a></sup> as a result of military action she was beginning to lose other sources of special metals which could not be replaced.

</p>
<link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r996844942"><blockquote class="templatequote"><p>My Lords, I wish to bring to your minds an almost forgotten Ministry. Back in 1939, in the early days of the war, the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Economic_Warfare" class="mw-redirect" title="Ministry of Economic Warfare">Ministry of Economic Warfare</a> was always in the headlines. Then some people thought and some people said that the war could be won by blockade alone without fighting, that Germany would suddenly collapse for lack of fuel, lack of special steels, even lack of food. In a bitter school we soon learnt differently. Even today, though Germany is extremely short of oil, she has enough for actual military operations, and her people are still reasonably well fed. But after those early days we went to the other extreme. Blockade by itself did not do the trick so we put it on one side in our minds. If the early hopes were exaggerated, we must not attenuate the actual achievements. The blockade almost certainly saved us from defeat. It quite certainly made it possible for us to win and has given us the precious time to make ready for the final blow. Some years ago an economic writer put it like this: "The blockade won't make Germany crack, but it will make her brittle." Now she is brittle, our armies can crack her. The blockade is more important now at the climax, on the eve of invasion, when the strain is telling, than ever before. The famished people of Europe must now look to the onward sweep of our advancing Armies coming as liberators and bringing bread in their train.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Roundell_Palmer,_3rd_Earl_of_Selborne" title="Roundell Palmer, 3rd Earl of Selborne">Lord Selbourne</a> told the house that the effect of the blockade, which may have been slight at first, had been cumulative, and Germany's greatest lack was now in manpower. While Britain was herself importing tens of millions of tons of supplies per year, the enemy was increasingly forced to use <a href="/wiki/Ersatz" class="mw-redirect" title="Ersatz">ersatz</a> industries. German civilian motor traffic had practically entirely gone over to <a href="/wiki/Producer_gas" title="Producer gas">producer gas</a>, which like all ersatz materials was grossly wasteful in manpower, and this, combined with her colossal losses in the field and the need to keep a disproportionately high percentage of its available labour on the land, had produced an acute manpower crisis requiring the use of some seven million foreign slaves in Germany alone. In June 1944 the British finally secured access to the naval bases on the Azores, and the Allies thereafter threatened Portugal with economic sanctions. In turn, Portugal imposed a complete embargo on all tungsten exports to both sides, leaving Germany with only its small supply from Spain, while the Allies had alternative sources in the Far East and South America.

<p>The German armies defending Normandy were badly restricted by their inability to bring up adequate fuel for their tanks and could only make troop and supply movements at night.

<p>After the initial success of D-Day and the breakout from the Normandy beachhead which followed, the advance began to slow due to the constant difficulties of keeping the vast armies supplied.<sup id="cite_ref-ConciseHistoryWWII_6-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ConciseHistoryWWII-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The problem was not getting supplies to the continent, but getting them to forward troops, which might be 500 miles (800&#160;km) from supply depots. Each division required 600–700 tons of supplies per day while artillery and mortars used 8 million rounds per month. The speed of advance often meant there was no time to build up an orderly logistical structure and, despite the use of a truck system called the <a href="/wiki/Red_Ball_Express" title="Red Ball Express">Red Ball Express</a>, for 5 days at the end of August virtually the entire American and British advance came to a complete halt due to a lack of fuel.
</p><p>The supply problem was worsened by the Allies' failure to capture a deep-water port able to unload large ships. The Germans, employing their scorched-earth policy, destroyed all dock facilities as they withdrew from the occupied territories in order to deprive the Allies of any logistical advantages. By early September the only remaining undamaged deep-water port was Antwerp in Belgium, and the SOE, under the direction of the Ministry of Economic Warfare (MEW) was given the task of ensuring it was captured intact. The operation, known as Counterscorch, involved sending radio operators into Belgium to liaise with the resistance, keeping them informed of Allied movements and supplying them with weapons and ammunition. At the allotted moment the resistance seized the port, keeping the Germans out until the Allies arrived, and Belgium was liberated in less than a week, although the port of Antwerp itself was not fully operational and capable of landing large cargoes until after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Scheldt" title="Battle of the Scheldt">Battle of the Scheldt</a> in late November.
</p><p>The supply problems also led to disagreements, as each commander pressed for his unit to be given priority. The supreme commander of Allied forces, U.S. General <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> wanted to advance on a broad front to overcome the West Wall (<a href="/wiki/Siegfried_Line" title="Siegfried Line">Siegfried Line</a>), but instead accepted British General <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery" title="Bernard Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a>, the plan to try to outflank the West Wall and drive into northern Germany to encircle the industrial Ruhr via the Netherlands. Market Garden was a disaster and did not achieve its main objective, while its few territorial gains actually stretched the supply lines even further.

<p>By early October the European military and political position had changed enormously and the MEW provided a statement of Germany's deteriorating position.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">&#91;79&#93;</a></sup> As a result of military operations in Lorraine and Luxembourg, the withdrawal of Swedish ships from trade with German ports, the closing of Swedish Baltic ports to German shipping, and the loss of supplies from Spain, it was estimated that iron ore supplies had been reduced by 65 per cent compared with 1943. In addition, about 45% of <a href="/wiki/Pig_iron" title="Pig iron">pig iron</a> manufacturing had been lost, together with 40% of steel furnace capacity. Supplies of copper from Turkey and Spain had been cut off, and the Germans had lost contact with sources of copper ores at Bor in Yugoslavia and <a href="/wiki/Outokumpu" title="Outokumpu">Outokumpu</a> in Finland. Loss of the Yugoslavian and other Balkan mines took away the last supplies of chromium and reduced the supply of lead by approximately 40 per cent – the position being worsened by the loss of substantial amounts of scrap which were collected in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. With the loss of high-grade French deposits and the seizure by Marshal <a href="/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito" title="Josip Broz Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>'s forces of the island fringe of Yugoslavia, Germany's total loss of bauxite was put at around 50 per cent, while the loss of shipments of cobalt from Finland was around 80 per cent of the total quantity with which Germany sustained that part of her synthetic oil production obtained by the <a href="/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_process" class="mw-redirect" title="Fischer-Tropsch process">Fischer-Tropsch process</a>.

<p>Meanwhile, in an attempt to assist the Allies in their liberation of the Netherlands, the exiled Dutch government called for a national rail strike to further disrupt German operations. The German authorities retaliated by placing an embargo on supplies of food into the western parts of the country. This caused severe hardship. By the time the embargo ended in November 1944 an unusually early and harsh winter had set in, leading to the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944" class="mw-redirect" title="Dutch famine of 1944">Dutch famine of 1944</a>. In the Balkans, the Ploiești oilfields were lost to Germany as an oil source from August 1944, and various opposing paramilitary groups and partisans united behind Marshal Tito. With Soviet help they began pushing Axis forces beyond Yugoslav borders, leading to further German losses of food and metals.

<p>In August 1944 Sweden determined that the danger to its merchant and naval vessels engaged in the iron ore trade to Germany had become too great,<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> and ceased exports in exchange for permission to import some of her own stores of cotton and wool shut off by the Allied blockade. In November all Swedish trade with Germany officially ended. After six months of negotiations, Switzerland also agreed to trim by one third her $60m yearly sales of machine goods and precision instruments to Germany and to cut sales of ball bearings to 10% and ammunition to 5% of the 1942 total.
</p><p>By this time, attacks on German fuel installations had been so successful that September's output was 8% that of April, and supplies were soon exhausted, just when fighter production reached its highest level.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Allied air commanders next began targeting German transport networks. On 24 September the RAF breached the <a href="/wiki/Dortmund%E2%80%93Ems_Canal" title="Dortmund–Ems Canal">Dortmund–Ems Canal</a> – an inland waterway linking the Ruhr with other areas – with <a href="/wiki/Tallboy_(bomb)" title="Tallboy (bomb)">Tallboy</a> bombs, draining a six-mile (10&#160;km) section. The enormous rail marshalling yard at Hamm was badly hit, leaving some 9,000 workers permanently engaged carrying out running repairs. On 12 November the battleship <i>Tirpitz</i> was sunk by RAF Tallboy bombs near <a href="/wiki/Troms%C3%B8" title="Tromsø">Tromsø</a>, Norway. The ship, known as the "Lonely Queen of the North" had seen little action through lack of fuel, and spent much of the war moored in a remote fjord. Around this time the RAF began reducing its attacks on synthetic oil production sites because none of the plants were now operating. Only the sites at Leuna and Polotz were still producing any oil, and though in December limited production restarted, further raids quickly put them out of action for good. Once the oil sites were bombed out in late 1944, transport became the primary target. Allied air power was now unstoppable.
</p><p>In late 1944 the German army launched the <a href="/wiki/Ardennes_Offensive" class="mw-redirect" title="Ardennes Offensive">Ardennes Offensive</a>, an attempt to split the Allied army, recapture Antwerp and force a negotiated peace. Despite early success, caused in part by severe Allied supply shortages, particularly of fuel, the operation eventually petered out. This was the last serious attempt by the German army to regain the initiative on land, although the Luftwaffe launched one final offensive with 800 aircraft against Allied airfields in Belgium, the Netherlands and France early in 1945.

<p>At the start of the war Germany's transport system, comprising modern autobahns, excellent railways and a complex network of interlinking canals and rivers was among the best in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> But after autumn 1943 the connections between industrial centres made attractive bomber targets which when effectively bombed badly affected the distribution of coal, which formed the basis of most military and industrial operations. Soon large parts of Germany's remaining transport network were paralysed, and the Ruhr became economically isolated from the rest of the Reich.
</p><p>Ultimately it was the sustained <a href="/wiki/Transport_Plan" title="Transport Plan">Allied bombing of the transport network</a> which broke Nazi resistance.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-79_16-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-79-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Despite his incredible efforts at continually reorganising production after each setback, from early 1945 Speer admitted defeat in the armaments battle. German industry was now unable to keep up with the high number of "Top Priority" weapons programmes, such as the production of the V weapons and calls for 3,000 Me 262 jet fighters and bombers per month. However, many factories maintained production right up to the moment Allied forces arrived at the gates.
</p><p>By now the V1 and V2 launch sites were being increasingly overrun, and with the Allies moving towards the Rhine and the Soviet armies rapidly closing in from the east, large numbers of refugees began to congregate in the cities, creating utter chaos.

<p>With the war all but won, there were increasing reports – mostly based on <a href="/wiki/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> and hearsay – that Nazi leaders were preparing to escape justice<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">&#91;81&#93;</a></sup> and were already preparing the way for the next war by secreting funds in neutral nations and moving resources abroad. From late 1944 onwards there were reports that rich German and Austrian Jews were being allowed to leave the Reich after paying special taxes and surrendering all their belongings to the Nazis. In December 1944 Allied intelligence sources indicated that German firms such as <a href="/wiki/Schering_AG" title="Schering AG">Schering</a>, <a href="/wiki/IG_Farben" title="IG Farben">IG Farben</a>, Bosch and <a href="/wiki/Mannesmann" title="Mannesmann">Mannesmann Rohrenwerke</a> were attempting to sell <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patents</a> to Swedish firms,<sup id="cite_ref-US_National_Archives_65-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-US_National_Archives-65">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup> and large chemical and electrical trusts, particularly IG Farben, were procuring foreign currency to finance Nazi activities abroad. In February 1945 food supplies were reported as being collected in the Austrian and <a href="/wiki/Bavarian_Alps" title="Bavarian Alps">Bavarian Alps</a> for Nazi fortresses and underground factories, and plans were apparently under way for the structural reorganization of the Nazi Party abroad by transferring money into agents' accounts in neutral countries. The Americans had information on a Fritz Mandl, a German national resident in Argentina who in January 1945 was sent several million <a href="/wiki/Argentine_peso_moneda_nacional" title="Argentine peso moneda nacional">pesos</a> through the State Bank of Spain to invest for Göring, <a href="/wiki/Goebbels" class="mw-redirect" title="Goebbels">Goebbels</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Himmler" class="mw-redirect" title="Himmler">Himmler</a>. By June 1945 German inventions were said to be in the safekeeping of the Swedish Aniline Company, with patents having been thrown onto the market through Swedish "dummy" intermediaries, and detailed information had been gathered on the financial backgrounds of a number of chemical, carbide and dye companies thought to be active as safe havens for Nazi property.
</p><p>The US-led <a href="/w/index.php?title=Safehaven_Program&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Safehaven Program (page does not exist)">Safehaven Program</a> was launched during the United Nations Conference at <a href="/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference" title="Bretton Woods Conference">Bretton Woods</a> in July 1944,<sup id="cite_ref-TeachersGuide_82-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TeachersGuide-82">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup> the same venue that prepared the ground for the modern <a href="/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> and <a href="/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" title="International Monetary Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF). The program provided for immediate measures to prevent any disposition, transfer, or concealment of looted gold or other assets, to deny any safe haven for Nazi looted assets in neutral countries, and for the eventual return of looted artefacts to their original owners. Most neutrals were eventually persuaded to reduce and end trade with Germany.
</p><p>The Swedish Government adopted tightened exchange control regulations in November 1944 and made great progress in identifying German properties and eliminating German influences from its economy. However, negotiations for the return of looted gold allegedly sent to Sweden by Germany as payment for goods dragged on for many years. Allied estimates of the value of looted gold ranged between $18.5 million and $22.7 million, but although the British, US and French agreed that Sweden's gold reserves had increased during the war, they were unable to agree how much – if any – of these rises were due to looted gold. Sweden eventually agreed to distribute more than $66 million in liquidated German assets as reparations, including a special $36 million fund at the <a href="/wiki/Riksbank" class="mw-redirect" title="Riksbank">Riksbank</a> to forestall disease and unrest in Germany and to finance purchases essential for the German economy. It also agreed to provide more than $8 million in gold to make up for that amount of Belgian monetary gold sold to Sweden during the War, but negotiations regarding 8,600 kilograms of Dutch gold ($9.7 million) stalled when Sweden argued that the gold had been acquired before the January 1943 London Declaration on looted gold. In April 1955 the Dutch claim was finally proved conclusive, and Sweden returned about $6.8 million in gold.
</p><p>Spain acquired a large quantity of gold from Germany, in some cases via Swiss intermediary companies, and negotiations coincided with Allied efforts to ostracize the Franco regime. A number of other countries also downgraded their diplomatic relations with Spain for having openly supported Hitler,<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> and Spain agreed to return an estimated $25 million in official and semi-official German assets in October 1946. Spain agreed to liquidate some $20–23 million of private German assets on the understanding she would keep around a quarter of the proceeds, and signed an agreement in May 1946 to return $114,329 (101.6 kilograms) out of about $30 million in looted Dutch gold that the Allies had identified at the Spanish Foreign Exchange Institute. The Allies publicly acknowledged that Spain had not been aware it was looted, and later Spain returned $1.3 million in gold bars and gold coins it had seized from German State properties at the end of the War. Negotiations continued, but with the coming of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> the US softened its approach and released over $64 million in assets frozen since the war, and allowed Spain to use its remaining gold as collateral for private loans.
</p><p>Because of its close financial ties with Germany, Allied representatives were especially keen to achieve Swiss co-operation. Although Swiss-German trade was generally considered to have ceased after November 1944, some companies, such as the Tavaro Munitions factory at Geneva, Switzerland, clandestinely shipped explosives to Germany, and German assets amounting to one billion francs still remained in Switzerland after November 1945. According to Under-Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/Dean_Acheson" title="Dean Acheson">Dean Acheson</a>, Switzerland was the last country to fully commit to the aims of Safehaven.<sup id="cite_ref-TeachersGuide_82-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TeachersGuide-82">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup> In February 1945, an American delegation sent to Switzerland initially thought it had achieved a substantial reduction in Swiss exports to Germany and an acknowledgment of Safehaven objectives for the blocking of German assets in Switzerland. But following subsequent discussions with Reichsbank Vice President <a href="/wiki/Emil_Puhl" title="Emil Puhl">Emil Puhl</a>, the Swiss later reneged on this agreement, and through the remainder of 1945 showed an unwillingness to embrace the Allied proposals to turn German assets in Switzerland towards the benefit of ravaged Europe and stateless victims of the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes. However, because of its excellent humanitarian record and protection of Allied POWs and other interests, the Allies ultimately decided against taking extreme measures against Switzerland.<sup id="cite_ref-Assets_64-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Assets-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Following the end of the war in Europe in early May 1945, large parts of Europe lay completely smashed. Acute food, housing and medical shortages continued for some time and around 10 million refugees housed in temporary encampments or on the roads.
</p><p>In the two emerging superpowers, Soviet Union and America, post-war productivity rose remarkably by 1948, although the reasons were very different. In Russia, great stimulus was given to emerging industries as a result of frenzied war production, helped in part by advanced industrial plants it took from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_occupation_zone_of_Germany" class="mw-redirect" title="Soviet occupation zone of Germany">Soviet occupation zone of Germany</a> after the war. America meanwhile, had been under severe depression in 1938, with vast industrial resources lying idle and 20% of the population unemployed. Rearmament, and later war brought these resources to life, which combined with rising investment and an intact infrastructure kept American industry buoyant, although considerable residual unemployment remained. Much the same situation existed in Canada, whose economy was closely tied to America, and who also suffered no fighting within its territory. The war changed the pattern of the international economy, leaving the US in a very strong bargaining position, having managed to free up international trade to its benefit as a consequence of Lend–Lease, and forcing the British to agree to currency convertibility.<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-123_83-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-123-83">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Britain's economy was badly hit by the abrupt ending of Lend-Lease a few days after the final defeat of Japan in August 1945. During the war Britain lost many of its lucrative export markets and now confronted an annual <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_payments" title="Balance of payments">balance of payments</a> deficit of £1.2billion.<sup id="cite_ref-Richards-Quick_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richards-Quick-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> As in World War I, Britain emerged from the war militarily triumphant but economically poorer (rationing did not end until 1953), and economist <a href="/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> was sent to America to negotiate a low-interest emergency loan of £3.75 billion to tide Britain over; the final repayment of £45.5m (then about $83m) was made on 31 December 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">&#91;84&#93;</a></sup>

A factor aggravating inflation was low productivity, caused in part by a lack of coal. France assumed it would become entitled to large volumes of German coal from the Ruhr as war reparations, but the Americans, who kept France and other countries going with a number of short-term loans and <a href="/wiki/Marshall_Aid" class="mw-redirect" title="Marshall Aid">Marshall Aid</a>, began to realise – correctly – that Europe needed the powerhouse German economy to restart growth and prevent the spread of communism, and refused to agree to reparations,<sup id="cite_ref-Purnell-123_83-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Purnell-123-83">&#91;83&#93;</a></sup> the very thing which led to German resentment after World War I and the rise of Hitler.
</p><p>In Germany herself, the people were left to start again from almost nothing, partitioned into zones which became east and west Germany for many years by the Allied powers, a time sometimes referred to as Hour Zero. Although they faced a massive task, with whole cities to be rebuilt and industries reorganised to peaceful production, within a few years the West German economy achieved a miraculous turn-around, and by 1950 a <a href="/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder" title="Wirtschaftswunder">Wirtschaftswunder</a> (economic miracle) was being proclaimed.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">&#91;85&#93;</a></sup> From 1951 onwards, France, West Germany, Italy and the <a href="/wiki/Benelux" title="Benelux">Benelux</a> nations began moves towards the unification of Western Europe with the creation of the <a href="/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community" title="European Coal and Steel Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC), the forerunner to the Modern <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a>. The ECSC created a <a href="/wiki/Common_market" class="mw-redirect" title="Common market">common market</a> to co-ordinate the supply of critical commodities to get the wheels of European commerce moving again.  An explicit aim of the ECSC and its successors was to minimise risk of future intra-European war, due to the trading links and better knowledge of one another.  In this, it has so far been 100% successful, with no two countries ever having waged war on one another while they were both members.
</p><p>The German synthetic-oil programme was so successful and advanced that during the world fuel crisis of the 1970s, caused by conflict and uncertainty in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, large American industrial concerns such as <a href="/wiki/Dow_Chemical" class="mw-redirect" title="Dow Chemical">Dow Chemical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Union_Carbide" title="Union Carbide">Union Carbide</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ultramar" title="Ultramar">Diamond Shamrock</a> began to reconsider the Nazi-era technology to see if it might provide a partial solution to their problems.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">&#91;86&#93;</a></sup> Some 300,000 documents relating to the history of the programme, including plant diagrams, patent descriptions, detailed reports on which catalysts and additives worked best, and monthly reports from the 25 oil from coal plants had fallen into American hands at the end of the war. At the time, <a href="/wiki/Crude_oil" class="mw-redirect" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a> was readily available at $2 per barrel, a fifth of the cost of man-made oil, and there was very little interest in the German documents. They remained in boxed storage at the <a href="/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration" title="National Archives and Records Administration">National Archives</a> in Washington for the next 30 years until chemical engineers began the arduous task of collating all the information and feeding it into a computer at the federally run <a href="/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory" title="Oak Ridge National Laboratory">Oak Ridge Energy Center</a>. Although the US managed to secure alternative non-Arabian oil supplies – mainly from <a href="/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> – synthetic oils are widely used today, mainly in specialised areas such as the airline industry and as lubricants.

<p>During the early months of the war – the so-called phoney war or Sitzkrieg – the activities of the men of Contraband Control were very newsworthy and provided good morale-boosting propaganda. Along with real-life accounts of German attacks on civilian fishing trawlers, news of attempts to defeat the magnetic mine, and official statistics of the monthly totals of seized cargoes, popular titles such as <i><a href="/wiki/War_Illustrated" class="mw-redirect" title="War Illustrated">War Illustrated</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Picture_Post" title="Picture Post">Picture Post</a></i> and the American magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a></i> served up a weekly diet of photographs and patriotic accounts of the latest British or French war successes, often with captions such as
